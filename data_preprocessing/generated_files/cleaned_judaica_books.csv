Anecdotes, Advice, Hanhagos,Brachos, and Segulos ofMaran Sar HaTorahHaRav Chaim Kanievsky zt""lWith these two words (shortened by Rav Chaim to theiracronym ""Buha!"" in his later years), the Gadol Hador blessed andencouraged the thousands who asked for his advice and brachos,whether in person, by phone (via his gabbai), or through the mail.What was the secret of Rav Chaim's famous ""Buha""?To know that, one first needs to know-or at least to get aglimpse of-the Gadol Hador himself.In Brachah V'hatzlachah, you will experience what it was liketo be in the close proximity of Maran Sar HaTorah, Rav ChaimKanievsky ztvk""l, on a daily basis. Like the proverbial ""fly on thewall,"" you will be able to listen in to the questions that were posedto him, and hear the amazing responses that he offered--often inonly a word or two.You will follow Rav Chaim on his awe-inspiring daily schedule;you'll get a taste of his remarkable ""chovos"" (the learning regimenthat enabled him to finish kol haTorah kulah each and every year);you will witness the miracles that seemed to be commonplacein Rav Chaim's presence. Most of all, you will get a glimpse ofgreatness that is hard to imagine-that is, until you read aboutit firsthand, straight from the pen of Rav Gedaliah Honigsbergshlit""a, Rav Chaim's grandson and trusted gabbai for decades,who actually was witness himself to all of the interactions andvignettes recorded in this book (originally Minchas Todah inHebrew).Read, and be amazed! Read, and become inspired! Read, andreceive chizuk from the gadol who, from his small corner onRechov Rashbam, cared about each and every Yid and blessedthem all with brachah v""hatzlachah.

An inspiring anthology that strengthens emunah and bitachonWhen Rav Wosner opened his eyes he sighed and ruled, ""The answer is clear. You have a strong claim against your partner. You may take him to a din Torah."" I well understood the meaning of a din Torah. The case would sprout wings and take flight as the scandal of the century. Before long, we'd be the talk of the town, and everyone in the neighborhood-in shuls, kollelim, and groceries-would be gossiping and analyzing our situation. Worst of all was the personal devastation it would wreak on our personal lives and immediate family. We weren't only friends; we were mechutanim twice over. I didn't want to imagine how it could impact our couples and grandchildren.Even in the ideal case that Heshy panicked upon receiving the summons to beis din, apologized, and returned the sum I vwas due, an iron wall would stand forever between us. How would we dance together at our grandchildren's chasunos? How would we sit side by side at the next bris? Suddenly, I realized that the tzaddik was still speaking. ""Certainly, you may go to beis din, but you should know that Hashem repays His children tenfold in This World when they yield for the sake of peace!""
102: The Gematria of EmunahRabbi Tzvi Nakar, contemporary maggid and author of the series Emunah Shleimah al HaTorah and Emunah Shleimah-Bar Mitzvah, weaves a tapestry of stories on emunah and bitachon. His powerful lessons and gripping tales of hashgachah pratis, most of which are drawn from modern times, enthuse and inspire, drawing the reader's heart to yearn for a deeper connection to Hashem. This updated English edition includes inspiring new stories from the COVID-19 pandemic.

And her baby, hersweet little Elchanan, couldn't hear any of it.She felt like her heart would crack in two at anymoment. What kind of life was her son destined tohave?One tear threatened to fall, but Rachel held itback. When she got home, she could give free reinto tears. She could cry over the life that her childwould face. But not yet. Not now. Now she neededto get out of here. She felt like she was suffocating.When they finally left, Dovid ordered a taxi, andshe heard him direct the driver to an unfamiliaraddress. Where were they going? She just wantedto go home. She didn't want to see anyone, to talkto anyone.""Where are we?"" she asked when the taxi stopped.""We're going to see Rav Chaim Kanievsky,"" Dovidsaid.

60 DAYS is really the story of each one of our lives, as expressed in perhaps the biggest rebuild after destruction? It's one thing to question of all: Is there hope after loss, can we rebuild after destruction? It's one thing to find happiness and life affirmation when we escape to a mountain; it's quite another to be able to experience it when we are immersed in a cruel, material life. Can we really find Truth in a corrupt world? Can we reach the highest places from our limited space? Can we taste eternity as mortal creatures? Can we touch heaven even as we stand on earth? Can we, as people and as nations, ever discover true peace?The 60-day story of Elul and Tishrei resolutely answers these questions with a resounding Yes. 24 and unequivocal ""Yes."" Yes, there is hope. Yes we can rebuild. Indeed, we can find an even greater love than the original one. Yes, we can marry heaven and earth. And our entire yes, world can unite in one magnificent symphony, each of us contributing our particular melody.To help us along, 60 DAYS - which taps into the special energy of this time period - provides us with a specific day by day plan, that covers the entire spectrum of human experience and addresses the different areas of work necessary to achieve reconciliation and renewal, sanctity and joy - in one dance of personal and cosmic transformation.

This is a book about""stars."" It's about people who light up the night with their choices. It's about men and women who are""preeminent"" in the daily challenges and struggles that we face. It's about courage and determination and fixing what's broken. And, of course, it's about great stories beautifully told.
Stories like Simi's, the freshly - minted CPA confronting illegal activity and an offer of a bribe. When her dream job becomes a nightmare she must choose between security... and her conscience. Stories like Mottel's, the philanthropist who takes a million dollar loan to keep his Tzedakah obligations, and who finds that Hashem Himself repays the money he owes. And stories like Arianna's, who discovers her stolen heritage in an unbelievable stroke of hashgacha pratis.
Author C.B. Weinfeld has a knack for uncovering engrossing true accounts everywhere - in a tire factory, a pawn shop, a beis medrash. And as she shows us the greatness of other Jews we find, amazingly enough, that we can discover it in ourselves as well. When the sky is darkest, we see the stars' glow much more clearly. When times are tough - that's when our choices light up our world. That's when we can reach the stars.

The Source Of The Final Redemption
A NIGHT TO REMEMBER presents a comprehensiveand in-depth study, revealing the secrets and sanctity ofPesach in a new light.
THIS LIGHT, the light from the ohr ha'ganuz (thehidden light) was originally revealed in the sifrei Maharal.After centuries of neglect, it was rekindled for the Torahworld by the appearance of the famous maamarim ofHagaon Harav Yitzchak Hutner, zt""l, and recorded in hissefarim, Pachad Yitzchak.
IT IS SAID that the Maharal had the keys to Chazal, andRav Hutner had the keys to the understanding of theMaharal, not to exclude his uncanny insights into thewords of the Ramban, the Gra, and many others.
TODAY, forty years after his passing - the years necessaryto understand the mind and ways of the Rav (""adataid'rabbai"") - his inspiration has brought about a crescendoof interest in his Torah, the maamarim. The light hebrought to the world continues to shine brightly.
""He was planted in this generation tobring light to the world and all whodwell in it - a new light""(FROM THE INSCRIPTION ON HIS TOMBSTONE)

He discerns nuance. He detectspatterns in the original Hebrew that once yousee them - seem to leap off the page. And heshows how many of these discoveries, astound-ingly, aren't really ""new"" at all, but were sug-gested thousands of years ago by the ancientsages of the Talmud and Midrash themselves.Underneath Rabbi Fohrman's approach to bib-lical text lies a simple conviction: inasmuch asreading a book is like having a conversationwith its author, reading the Bible is like havinga conversation with our Creator. When we readthe Torah, therefore, we should do it the waywe should converse with those who are deeplyimportant to us: stop talking so much; slowdown... and just listen.In Leviticus: A Parsha Companion, Rabbi Fohr-man helps the reader really listen to the Torah -carefully, lovingly, and attentively. The reader'sreward is the chance to perceive the richnessin the Torah many of us had never imaginedwas there, and to be touched deeply by a closeencounter with the words or our Maker.

A Matter of Truth, Justice, and DenigrationThe transmission of the Laws of the Torah and its teachingshas been faithfully practiced from Moses at Sinai until this day.Jews can never accept the claim by any leader of any people thathe was sent to replace Judaism. It is simply a false claim.Likewise, because of their status as God's elected people,Israel never gets away with their transgressions. When the DivineJustice strikes them, it is not because they are rejected by God,as the Quran claims (Surah 5:18), rather, it is on account of theirproximity to God.
Maimonides Writes:Just as God is everlasting, so is His Torah. No one may addto it nor remove any law from it, as it says: ""The entire wordthat I command you, that shall you observe to do, you shallnot add to it and you shall not subtract from it"" (Deuteronomy13:1). Therefore, if a man, be he Jew or gentile, will declarethat God sent him to add a commandment to the Torah ofMoses or subtract from it, or to add an explanation which wehave not learned from Moses or who would claim that thosecommandments which the Israelites have inherited are not forall generations to come, this man is a false prophet.(Maimonides, Laws of Torah Principles, 9:1)

We may even feel, in the depths of our despair, that even God has forgotten about us.
 The ultimate emergence from loneliness is through a consciousness that you are here for a unique reason and mission that only you can achieve.
 All of the Avos and Imahos were alone. From Avraham standing alone against a world of idol - worship to King David who was alone in his rejection by his family. Sarah was alone in her tent and Esther was alone in the palace of Achashverosh.
 How did they cope with their challenges of aloneness?
 Let us journey together through the Torah and Tanach, and discover a pathway to transform existential loneliness into empowering independence.

Uplifting Stories of Courage, Faith and MiraclesFrom The United Hatzalah Heroes of October 7th
The epic story that began with90 Secondscontinues...ANGELS-IN-ORANGEIncredible stories of emunah, hashgachah, miracles, and courageas more than 1,700 United Hatzalah volunteersrescue and treat the woundedon Simchas Torah, October 7th, 2023The sirens in Yerushalayim began wailing at 6:30a.m. Within minutes, EliBeer, founder and president of United Hatzalah, was rushing to UnitedHatzalah headquarters. Clearly, something terrible was happening downsouth. How could United Hatzalah send civilian volunteers to what was anactive war zone? But how could they abandon thousands of wounded Jews?The decision? They would warn every volunteer of the serious risks - andgive them permission to save lives.And so more than 1,700 volunteers donned their bright orange vests andsped down to the battleground of southern Israel.Bestselling author Rabbi Nachman Seltzer interviewed dozens of thosevolunteers, and here are their stories. The maggid shiur on his ambucyclewho braved a sniper's bullets to try and save a wounded policeman. Thevolunteer who took cover behind a tank while terrorists dressed as IDFsoldiers shot at him. The team who took care of twin babies who'd survived,though their parents had not. The ambulance that brought hundreds of pairsof tzitzis for soldiers begging for them.Rabbi Seltzer has written their amazing stories of courage and survivalwith great sensitivity for reader's feelings. We will be inspired and uplifted aswe read about the volunteers' mesiras nefesh, the miracles that almost everyvolunteer saw and experienced, and their selfless caring for their fellow Jewsduring one of the most dangerous times in Israel's history.
Angels in Orange captures the drama, the pain, and, most of all, themiracles, heroism, and hashgachah pratis of October 7th.

""I got shot with a bullet in my left hand, my left leg, and my chest... They latertold me that I was on the floor for three hours. I couldn't believe it.

By age seven, Aharon Margalit had already suffered a terrible trauma which rendered him mute, and was lying in a sanitarium, completely paralyzed by polio. His mother's indomitable efforts to save him from paralysis are inspiration enough, but as the story unfolds, the inspiration mounts. This is a man who meets tragedy with perfect calm; who has fought cancer three times - and with a positive, assertive spirit that boggles the mind. This is a book that will give strength, courage, and hope to every reader, young and old, no matter where their life's journey has brought them. A testament to faith, optimism, and the power of mind over matter. When Rav Chaim Kanievski was presented with this book in the original hebrew, Es'halech, he read it cover to cover and announced that it gave him chizuk. See what it can do for you!

Stories and Insights of Grandeur and RedemptionAt the Maggid's Seder he commandment of Sipur Yetzias Mitzrayim, to recount the miracles of our Exodus from Egypt, is one of the most beloved of mitzvos. What better way can we find to fulfill this command than by sharing stories of courage, emunah, compassion, and spiritual heroism?And what better person can we find to tell us those stories than Rabbi Paysach Krohn, the famed ""American Maggid""?In At the Maggid's Seder, we are treated to Rabbi Krohn's incisive and absorbing comments on the Haggadah. And more: This unique commentary also includes close to 100 (!) stories, told in a way that only Rabbi Paysach Krohn can tell them.
Why did the lovely silver dish become a symbol of maror, of the bitterness of exile? How did Rav Hutner react at the Seder when a student spilled wine all over the Rosh Yeshivah's kittel? How did a young man's search for truth end up in a beautiful shidduch? In story after story, we see that many of the themes of the Seder play out in our own lives. We gain a better, deeper understanding of slavery and liberation, of faith and devotion.In this unique commentary, Rabbi Krohn invites us to enjoy a ""virtual Seder"" with him. In his own words: ""It is my hope and prayer that the stories and insights in this Haggadah will elevate and enhance your Seder, so that all at your table will take with them an exhilarating feeling of awe, joy, and gratitude....""So join Rabbi Krohn At the Maggid's Seder, and see how much this Haggadah will enhance and enrich your own Seder as well.INCLUDES FULL HAGGADAH WITH ENGLISH TRANSLATION

It's The Place To Go, If You Want To Know The Full Story!• The almanah desperately wanted to honor her late husband withthe writing of a Sefer Torah. But with ten yesomim to take care of,it seemed an impossible dream. Until a certain askan took a trip toa cemetery and things began happening backstage...• To all who knew her, she was a wonderful, caring, Bais Yaakougirl. But to an overloaded chinuch system she was a ""leftover,""the girl no high school could find room for Until her father tookcare of some unfinished business - and things began happeningbackstage...Why do tens of thousands love to read C.B. Weinfeld's stories?Maybe it's because they fill us with hope, optimism, and emunah. Orbecause even as they touch our hearts they open our eyes to the wonders of ourlives. Perhaps it's the surprise endings, the unexpected twists and turns. And, ofcourse, it's certainly because C.B. Weinfeld tells really great stories.In Backstage, we'll be taking behind-the-scenes looks at a harried Rebbetzindealing with a major kiddush where everything that could go wrong... does. Andwe'll see how ""backstage"" nothing could have been better. In these stories, whichoriginally appeared in Yated Ne'eman or Ami Magazine, we'll meet youngpeople in shidduchim, men and women dealing with parnassah or shalombayis or countless other contemporary challenges with faith and courage. Anda special treat: Backstage features a ""mini-novelette"" based on a true story ofa heroic mother's journey through a life-altering medical condition, a story ofhope, strength, and tremendous reserves of faith.As we go ""backstage,"" we will see, with magnificent clarity, how Hashemtakes good care of His precious children.

The Etrog in Jewish Art,Culture, and History
Edited by Warren Klein, Sharon Liberman Mintz,and Jashua TeplitskyThe etrog is a curious fruit. The Bible (Leviticus 23:40)commands its readers: ""And you shall take for yourselveson the first day beautiful tree-fruit (peri etz hadar), palmfronds, boughs of leafy trees, and willows of the brook, andyou shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days.""Native to the Far East and adapted to the culture ofthe eastern Mediterranean, the rituals of the etrogare among the very few that are dependent upon aparticular environment for growth that Jews havemaintained in their vast dispersal from the originsof their law, heritage, and collective existence in theLand of Israel. In their wanderings across the globe,the etrog has remained part of Jews' practices, anindispensable part of the annual rhythms of theJewish harvest festival, Sukkot, the Feast of Booths.This collection of essays explores the long and engagingstory of the etrog as a tale of home-away-from-home, ofwandering and belonging, of tradition and adaptation.The etrog's story is one of environment, climate, andagriculture; of commerce and cooperation; of bordersand crossings; of visual splendor; of experimentationand innovation in Jewish art, culture, and history.

It was not published during his lifetime, and remained in manuscript form with family members for close to a century, before it was made available to the public by his great-grandchildren.Now, at last, English-speaking readers can access the treasures of faith and trust that were hidden away for so many years. The Beis HaLevi on Bitachon includes the entire original text; a flowing, elucidated translation; a wide-ranging commentary that explores the many facets of emunah and bitachon, drawing upon the works of dozens of Torah sages; and an Overview by. ""Insights"" appear throughout the book, bringing a contemporary focus to bitachon, and fundamental topics are dealt with more in depth in the Appendix section. The Maharal discussed the importance of reciting pesukim about emunah every day. This volume includes a special section with such pesukim compiled by Rav Zundel of Salant, together with a prayer for strengthening our emunah.
The Beis HaLevi on Bitachon gives us clear answers to many of life's most important questions. What is the proper balance between hishtadlus, effort, and bitachon, trust? How should a person react in times of trouble? Why does fear have no place in a Jew's life? What are the many benefits of bitachon - in this world and the next?
The Beis HaLevi on Bitachon is the hidden treasure - finally revealed! - which will bring us to the faith and trust so vital to our lives.

The Life and Legacy ofReb Moshe Reichmann
""I've seen people for whom Margaret Thatchershowed respect, and I've seen people for whom RavYaakov Kamenetsky stood up. But I have knownonly one man for whom Rav Yaakov would expressadmiration, and toward whom heads of statewould bow.""
""When you left his study, you didn't just have agenerous check: you had dignity, respect, and anew sense of pride in what you were doing.""It's the story of a journey to spiritual greatness, to faith, humility,and extraordinary generosity, a story that takes us throughconstruction sites and boardrooms as well as the hallowed halls ofyeshivos and batei midrash.Aristocratic in conduct and speech, Reb Moshe Reichmanntreated other people in a way that left them feeling that they hadbrushed with royalty, elevating himself and those around him. Thekindness and attention he invested in his family flowed outwardto impact every corner of the Torah world, conveying respect andencouragement along with his donations.The most respected financiers on earth were in awe of him, yetthis same Mr. Reichmann would bow deferentially whenspeaking to Torah scholars. He was patron to institutions andindividuals, giving not just money, but time, attention, and genuineconcern. Yisroel Besser, author of many bestselling books, includingthe unforgettable Just Love Them, brings us a story that will make usnewly sensitive to the potential to give that lies within us.

Tolive properly, we must serve the Creator and fulfill His mitz-vos, and build a proper lifestyle which will fill us with vitalityand joy. It is upon us to turn inward, and to live in harmonywith our self, with others, and with our Creator. The way toget there is through the practical inner work of actualizingthe soul, in a way that is structured, fundamental, encom-passing, and consistent.

Computers and automated systems have given rise to new forms of trade never dreamed of in days gone by. But these new business methods have also brought a host of Shabbos - related halachic questions not clearly addressed by Poskim of the previous generation.
 
 
 
 Is one permitted to list an item on ebay if the auction is scheduled to conclude on Shabbos? 
 
 May one allow his e - commerce website to remain open on Shabbos? 
 
 What should be done if one cannot possibly close his business on Shabbos, such as a nursing home or a store in a mall? 
 
 Must one close his business in a different time zone once it is Shabbos in his location? 
 
 
 
 These issues, as well as hundreds of others, are discussed in a relevant, clear and concise way with all final rulings based on the original rulings of Rav Shlomo Miller. With its clear, down - to - earth style, as well as its extensive source material in the footnotes, this important work provides informative answers for both the inquiring businessman as well as the accomplished scholar.

This story has a unique aspect to it, for it needs to be told as if we are experiencing it in the present. Thus we are told in the Haggadah: ""In each and every generation, a person is obligated to see himself as if he came out of Egypt."" Why is it so important to tell the story as if it is happening to us now? After all, we left Egypt long, long ago!
 
 
 
 In this remarkable, easy - to - read, and thought - provoking commentary on the Passover Haggadah, Rabbi Immanuel Bernstein brings a wealth of sources, a lucidity of thought, and tremendous originality in order to help understand what the goal of the Seder really is, and how we can best experience this powerful evening.

Masters of Jewish thought, such as the Maharal, Ramchal, Rav Tzadok, and the Sfas Emes, provide us with deeper meaning and understanding of Torah, mitzvos, and life. Often, however, to fathom their teachings, it is necessary to have a broad knowledge and grasp of Torah and their works.Rabbi Ahron Rapps peels away the layers of darkness and shines penetrating light upon their lessons, providing his readers with a familiarity and keen awareness of their role in God's creation. His words shine forth as a menorah on a dark night, drawing us closer to vital concepts and holy acts.Prior to when he began his weekly column on these matters in the Yated, I did not know Rabbi Rapps. I turned to our rebbi, Rabbi Moshe Shapiro, zt""l, for guidance as to whether to offer him a column. He accepted responsibility for Rabbi Rapps and greatly encouraged me to publish his columns.I am confident that he and the other great rebbeim of Rabbi Rapps are celebrating the publication of this work, which serves to further dispel the darkness of the exile and will lead to the return of the great light that will shine with the coming of Mashiach speedily in our day.Rabbi Pinchos Lipschutz

Every Shabbos they fit 150 or more people in their small Jerusalem living room, preparing for their guests over 40 chickens, three different kugels, countless salads, four desserts, and, of course, gefilte fish, chicken soup, and cholent - both traditional and vegetarian. Brooklyn - born Henny Machlis was at the heart of this amazing weekly adventure. But, as author Sara Yoheved Rigler, bestselling author of Holy Woman and a friend of Henny's, discovered as she interviewed Henny's fourteen children, relatives, students, and friends, the Shabbos hospitality was just one glowing facet of the multi - faceted diamond that was Rebbetzin Henny Machlis. A master of prayer, a virtuoso in chesed, an adept in childrearing, a wise Torah teacher, an expert at working on middos, and a successful shadchanit, Henny Machlis regarded a life of Torah and mitzvos as a great treasure that she was eager to share with everyone. And her emunah, her faith in G-d's love and providence? That was where her light shone the most brightly. She lived on the Planet of Emunah, a place where miracles were everyday occurrences, because she knew, really knew, that only Hashem is in charge and He can do anything. And, for Henny, He often did. Like a steaming bowl of chicken soup, this book will satisfy you. Comfort you. And heal you - in a way that only Rebbetzin Henny Machlis could. Sip it. Savor it. And be inspired and transformed.

After the babies died, I was surethat nothing terrible could happen to us ever again. Not to us.Then, Yossi, our oldest child and only son, drownedsix weeks before his wedding day.As a child, Yossi loved playing with words. Once, when hewas getting ready for school, I said to him, ""There are bagelson the counter if you're hungry.""He said, ""Even if I'm not.""""What?""""The bagels are on the counter even if I'm not hungry.""After Yossi died, I grappled with long-held beliefs: Hashem isclose; everything that happens has a purpose; and ourneshamos continue to exist after we leave This World.

Journey BeyondWho We Think We Are
We are infinitely morethan we think we are.Our families, communities, and schools may influenceour lives - for better or the opposite - but, at the end ofthe day, it is we, not they, who determine how great wecan become as we progress on the journey we call life.As awesome as our personal potentials are, we needto forever be expanding them beyond our currentunderstanding as we continue discovering more aboutwho we are within.Drawing from the vast sea of Chassidic wisdom andmany works of psychology and human development,Jonah Simcha Chaim invites readers on a journey intothe core of who they are beneath the layers of defensemechanisms and protective armor - as they strive toconquer the world around them.
Expanding Potential is an exploration of empowerment,vulnerability, courage, and growth, set against thebackdrop of the Jewish calendar. It's a rebellion againstwho we're told we need to be, in favor of who we chooseto become. It's about breaking the limits to which otherstry to confine us and, out of those fragments, creatingour own masterpiece.

Hasany posek ever wondered if one may send mishloach manos with adrone?Rabbi Ryzman researches, analyzes, and elucidates.

It includes his analysis of issues relating to Israel's battleagainst Hamas, such as► What Are the Priorities in Saving Lives?► What Are the Issues in Ransoming Hostages?Among the other fascinating topics in this volume: May aShabbos observer trade shifts with a non-observant Jew? May oneschedule elective surgery a few days before Shabbos? May one desecrateShabbos to help a person in emotional distress? And there are manymore.Rabbi Ryzman researches, analyzes, and explains. He is not onlya great scholar, he is a master teacher. When he's finished, we havea clear understanding of the issues and of how the author and thegreat poskim apply classic principles to current dilemmas.Are you interested in joining adventures in halachic exploration?Then Exploring Modern Halachic Dilemmas Vol. 4 is for you!

Amos Hanavi (8:11) predicted that preceding Mashiach'sarrival there would be famine - not for bread and water,a but for the word of Hashem. This explains why more andmore people find themselves needing the nourishment of the deeperlayers of Torah.
Festivals of Faith, presenting the Torah of Rav Moshe Wolfson, shlita,Rav of Beis Midrash Emunas Yisrael and Mashgiach Ruchani of MesivtaTorah Vodaath, attempts to satisfy this hunger and quench this thirst.Written in a light and engaging style, the Festivals of Faith series drawsfrom the mystical layers of Torah as transmitted through the channelsof Chassidus.Sprinkled throughout are astounding gematrios, marvelous sidebars, andnext-level appendices - and each chapter ends with a practical takeaway.This series opens up the rich resources of the Jewish year, enabling ouremunah to blossom with the Festivals of Faith.

The Chinuch Legacy ofRabbi Chanina HerzbergInfusing the essence ofRabbi Shlomo Freifeldinto the next generation
Forever a Talmid tells the story of mesorah reverently handeddown generation to generation. The story of the timeless rebbi-talmid bond. The story of greatness in the yeshivah, the classroom,and the home - and the story of the power of one man's warmth,determination, and belief in every Jew.Charlie Herzberg was a regular American boy. Fantastic third baseman,popular with his classmates, not a top student. But there were Torahscholars and leaders who saw a spark of greatness in young Charlie. Whobelieved in him, and helped him believe in himself. And so he grew upto become Rabbi Chanina Herzberg, the master mechanech who alwaysbelieved in his talmidim and who always, always, remained a talmid of hisown rebbi, Rav Shlomo Freifeld.A talmid muvhak of Rav Freifeld, Rabbi Herzberg was the recipient ofa glorious mesorah - from the Alter of Slabodka to Rav Yitzchak Hutnerto Rav Freifeld, whom he consulted on a regular basis. He brought thatmesorah of gadlus ha'adam, the greatness of man, into every aspect of hislife. As menahel of Yeshiva Toras Chaim at South Shore for decades, RabbiHerzberg had a vision of what a yeshivah should be: A place where everychild ""connects to the Ribbono shel Olam, and learns to be a mensch.""He took care of everyone - rebbeim, morahs, teachers, parents, and, ofcourse, talmidim - bringing out the best in them, because he truly sawwhat was best in them.In Forever a Talmid we will read story after story about RabbiHerzberg, Rav Freifeld, and the others who were so central to his life. Wewill learn how much work it takes to be a true talmid, and the enormous,uncountable benefits. And how a few words spoken at the right timecan change a person's life. And how if we believe in a child or talmid -indeed, in any person - he will learn to believe in himself.And, yes, we will learn how to believe in ourselves as well.

Includes""Holocaust Connection""
Galus Mitzrayim was theforerunner of all of our People'ssubsequent exiles, forging a pathtoward the birth of our nationand its destiny throughout theages. Indeed, delving into the storyof yetzias Mitzrayim is what solidifiesthe basics of our faith-and that is thepurpose of this Haggadah.In Foundations of Faith (formerlyThe Holocaust Haggadah), Rabbi GershonWeiss zt""l, esteemed rav, prolific writer, andprevious menahel ruchani of the Yeshivahof Staten Island, shows how the principlesof Jewish faith taught by the Sages in theHaggadah can be applied to the mostdifficult ordeals of our national history.Through a profound examination ofthe nature of our relationship withHashem, and peppered with truestories of our People's unparalleledcourage and bitachon, this Haggadahoffers a new and deep understanding ofyetzias Mitzrayim, as well as a perspectiveon the Holocaust-and galus in general-that will enrich our lives.

A New Look At How The TorahConveys Ideas Through Numbers
Gematria is a polarizing topic.While many love it, many othersview it with skepticism.
What is the purpose of gematria? Can we truly learn anythingfrom the numerical representation of words? What is beneaththese creative yet apparently simplistic interpretations?While jointly pursuing semichah and a PhD in mathematics,it seemed natural for Elie Feder to love gematria. However,he was bothered by these compelling questions. That is,until he discovered the purpose of gematria.
Gematria Refigured presents the discoveries that led to theauthor's transformation from a gematria skeptic to a gematrialover. Through its many examples, it develops a theory thatelucidates how the Torah and Chazal use gematria to direct ustoward a very specific type of idea and to provide perspectivesinto many mitzvos, themes, and stories in Tanach.

""Both fascinating and eye-opening....I highly recommend that the tzibbur learnsthrough this work.""Rabbi Yitzchak BerkovitsRosh Yeshiva, Aish HaTorah and the Jerusalem Kollel

The Haggadah. It's our story. Let's make sure we tell it well.
Seder night commemorates the greatest true story of all time - the night when Hashem, in His splendor, came down Himself, personally, to liberate His People, the Jews. It is the night of our miracles and our liberation.
It's the night of our stories.

Rabbi Yechiel Spero - acclaimed educator, erudite Torah scholar and, of course, gifted storyteller - tells some of those stories in this engaging new Haggadah that is certain to enhance our sedarim.

In his many bestselling books, Rabbi Spero does a masterful job of bringing Torah insights to life through unusual stories. Touched by Our Story includes his wide - ranging, stimulating commentary on the Haggadah and, of course, Rabbi Spero's trademark true stories. The Four Sons come to life, in tales like that of the rosh yeshiva who played""jacks"" with a youngster or the gadol ha'dor who insisted a yeshiva change its language to accommodate two students who genuinely wanted to learn. We hear what the Klausenberger Rebbe had to say at a seder not long after his liberation, and are amazed at the connection between the plague of Frogs and the remarkable survival of two victims of a ghastly terror attack.

Enlightening, engaging and eye - opening, this is a Haggadah that will ensure a lively, meaningful and enjoyable seder for us, our guests, and - most important of all - our children, the next generation to tell the stories.

Here's a haggadah that makes a Seder interactive... and unforgettableWe've got the wine, the matzah, the stunning table settings. Now, all that's missing to make the perfect Seder is... questions! Lots of questions!
Chazal, the Jewish Sages, instructed that the story of the Exodus be told in question - and - answer style, reflecting the wording of the Torah's commandment to relate the story, "" And it shall be when your son will ask you ""(Shemos 13:14). When a person asks a question, it shows that he is interested in hearing an answer, and he becomes an engaged participant in the discussion.
The Pesach haggadah: The Answer Is... generously fulfills this dictate, with over 1000 answers to more than 300 questions! The Pesach Haggadah: The Answer Is... takes us through every facet of the Seder and the Passover story - the 4 sons, the 10 plagues, the unbelievable miracles of liberation, even the fascinating but puzzling poem Chad Gadya that ends the Seder - by asking questions and offering answers. We see the Exodus through the eyes of luminaries such as Rambam and the Vilna Gaon, Rav Moshe Feinstein and the Belzer Rebbe, and literally hundreds more.
Take a thoughtful question, give an intelligent and articulate answer, and you've got an interactive, dynamic and spirited experience. Multiply that by hundreds of questions and answers - and you have a Seder you will never forget.

In this work, he brings these varying fields together, presenting a clear, profound study of the very practical aspects of Hilchos Shabbos, illustrated with common, real-life scenarios. Besides the practical halachos, Rav Neustadt introduces the reader to the very vibrant world of contemporary halachic debate and discussion. The relevance of the issues, the lucid language, and the extensive sources and footnotes, make this work an important and welcome addition to the library of every Jewish home.This book is a project of Machon Ohr Olam. For more than a decade, Machon Ohr Olam has been dedicated to enriching the world of Halachah among English-speaking Jewry worldwide - in study and in practice by publishing halachic works in clear English, which bring together profound, in-depth study and practical instruction. The peak of this endeavor is the publication of the translated and elucidated English Mishnah Berurah. The book you now hold originated as a supplement to the Mishnah Berurah, published at the end of each volume. Seeing the enthusiasm for this particular section, with its very contemporary, practical nature, we are proud to present it as a work on its own.

Letters And Talks Of The Lubavitcher Rebbe,Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson""Since one is only human, it is not unusual to relapse occaionallyinto a mood of discouragement. But, as has been explained in theTanya and in other sources, such a relapse should only serve as achallenge to bring forth additional inner reserves and energy to over-come the tactics of the Yetzer Hara, and to do even better than before.I trust that since you wrote your letter, your mood and outlook haveconsiderably improved, and that this letter will find you in a com-pletely different frame of mind. Nevertheless, I am sending you thisletter, since one is only human and subject to changes of mood, asmentioned above.Finally, I want to say that the above should not be understood to meanthat if you do find yourself in such a frame of mind, you should tryto conceal it and not write about it. For our Sages have said ""Whena person has an anxiety, he should relate it to others,"" for gettingsomething off one's chest is in itself already a relief.With Blessing,M.

While staying with a patient in a health care facility, visitors and caregivers often encounter halachic questions that they have not previously faced:

May one daven in the presence of a catheter?
May one enter a bathroom on Shabbos if he will activate automatic lights?
May one use the 'call button' on Shabbos to call a nurse for the choleh's needs?
My one leave food in a public place, unwatched?
activating automatic lights, using call buttons for the choleh, leaving food unwatched.

These questions and many others are addressed in Hospitals in Halacha in a clear and concise manner. The answers are based on the rulings of leading Poskim and were reviewed by HaRav Y.E. Forshheimer, shlit""a.

An Inspiring Collection ofSources For The CommandmentTo Love G-d
How to Love G-d is a collection ofexcerpts to inspire one to love G-d.The excerpts have been selectedfrom Tanach, Talmud, commentaries,earlier and later authorities, Jewishphilosophers and Chassidic texts.What characterizes love the way it issupposed to be? A person's love forG-d has to be intense, enormouslypassionate, causing him to be entirelypreoccupied by it, just like one who islovesick. His mind is always on thelove-object, whether he is at rest, inmotion - even while he eats and drinks.The love of G-d should involve those wholove Him even more completely than thelove of a human being, since we arecommanded in the verse ""With all yourheart and all your soul."" This is thecontent of Solomon's parable ""For I amlovesick"" (Song of Songs 2:5). In fact, theentire Song of Songs is one continuingmetaphor for this aspect of loving G-d.

You can stop fighting with your teenager!What happens when a child crosses into the daunting territory of adolescence? For too many parents, the answer is deeply troubling: the son or daughter they thought they knew turns into a sullen stranger who criticizes their taste, challenges their rules, and rejects their values. Some parents react by laying down the law and punishing any transgression, however minor. Others respond by throwing up their hands and hoping for the best. Sadly, either approach-""Do as I say"" or ""Do what you want""-cuts off the possibility of communication with the most significant grown-ups in a young person's life.

The Ramban's Ethical LetterWith An Anthology ofContemporary Rabbinic ExpositionsIf one had to make a short list of the greatest of the classic medievalcommentators, Ramban, or Nachmanides, would be near the top ofthe list. Rav Moshe ben Nachman was born in Spain in 1194/4934, andwas the crown of that country's golden age of Jewish scholarship forhis whole lifetime, until he was forced into exile because of his spiritedand intellectually successful battle against the strenuous efforts of theCatholic Church to convert Spain's Jews.He spent the last years of his enormously productive life writing hismonumental commentary on the Chumash, beginning it in Spain andcompleting it in Eretz Yisrael. Another gem of those final years wasIggeres HaRamban, the letter in which Ramban set forth eloquently andpithily the ethical principles by which his son should conduct himself.Just as Ramban's voluminous works have made us all his students, so hisLetter has made us all his children. Through the centuries, countless Jewshave made it their practice to study Iggeres HaRamban regularly: someread it and contemplate upon it every day; others do so every week orevery month.In this book, one of those students, Rabbi Avraham Chaim Feuer,shares with us what Ramban's Letter has taught him, for, like all the worksof the master, its every word and thought lends itself to introspection andinsight, to situations that face us every day in our personal and publiclives. Beginning with a user-friendly interlinear translation, the authorgoes on to comment on the Letter, and then gives a broad selection ofbeautiful and thought-provoking insights drawn from the millennia-longriches of rabbinic literature.By sharing with us what Ramban has taught him and the road map ofconduct upon which the Letter has led him, Rabbi Feuer becomes a guideand inspiration to the countless sons and daughters in all generations towhom Ramban's Letter is addressed.

Bitachon: Trusting In G-D
100 Letters And Talks Of The Lubavitcher Rebbe,Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson
The Letters - A Rock-Solid Trust:In this world, people sometimes feel alone; G-d seems to behiding His Face. Thus it was that over the years, thousandsof forlorn strugglers, groping in the dark for the Hand of theDivine Shepherd, poured out their hearts to the Rebbe withthe request that he help them find their bearings. The lettersin response, whether simplistic or philosophical, are candid,but always compassionate. The Rebbe's perspective providesa healing rope that can lift one's inner burdens, dispelling theclouds of worry, like a mountain that is suddenly uplifted.Above all, these letters empower their readers with a rock-solid trust - that even at such times they are in good hands.
The Talks - Recurring Themes:Instead of passively awaiting supernatural intervention, youdecide to create a natural conduit (such as working for aliving) for the downward flow of Divine blessings. Does thatmean that your trust in G-d is imperfect?If G-d is the ultimate Healer, how can the Sages approve ofmedical intervention?How can you honestly trust that you will be granted manifestgood, when you know that some people are more deservingand others are perhaps less so?Chassidim say, ""Think positively, and things will be positive!""What does this mean?

It can't be to tell Hashem what we need. He knows that already.
It can't be to ask Hashem to change something He already decreed. Everything He does is for the best, so why should we intervene?
It can't be just to elevate ourselves. If so, how does praying for someone else work?
WE PRAY EVERY DAY, BUT DO WE UNDERSTAND WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH?With profound and penetrating insights gleaned from a thorough review of Torah sources, Insights into Tefillah explains clearly the basics of prayer. One by one, Rabbi Prof. Avraham Weinroth answers the difficult questions associated with prayer, and inspires to a higher level of Divine service. In addition, he discusses: intent (kavanah), preparation before tefillah, praying for the sick, women's prayer, Birkas Kohanim, and Kaddish.Now you too can daven fully and deeply, and achieve true deveikus with Hashem!

Profiles of more than 450 individual Jewish physicians are divided by region and area of specialization, all within a historical context-from talmudic times to the modern era, from Islamic and Christian lands to the spread of Jewish communities in Europe after the Spanish Inquisition. The large section devoted to the modern era focuses on European and American physicians, including the substantial number of Jewish Nobel Prize winners in the field. The book concludes with a description of physicians who were leaders in the Zionist movement and those who contributed to the development of medicine in the State of Israel.

Its history, origins, decline, and rebirth are simply fascinating. Furthermore, at its deepest level, Lashon HaKodesh is called such (""the Holy Language"") because it is intrinsically sacred - and is thus unlike any other language known to Man.
Lashon HaKodesh: History, Holiness, & Hebrew seeks to understand the holiness of Lashon HaKodesh, follows its history, and focuses on the significance of Aramaic and other""Jewish languages"" such as Yiddish and Ladino. An extended section is devoted to Modern Hebrew, its controversies, and its implications from a religious perspective. This unique work delves into the linguistic history of each""Jewish language"", as well as the philological, Kabbalistic, and Halachic approaches to this topic taken by various Rabbinic figures through the ages. The author also compares and contrasts traditional Jewish views to those of modern - day academia,offering proofs and difficulties to both approaches.As the old saying goes, ""Two Jews, three opinions."" In almost every chapter, more than one way of looking at the matter at hand is presented. In some cases, the differing opinions can be harmonized, but ultimately many matters remain subject to dispute. Hopefully, the mere knowledge of these sources will whet the reader's intellectual curiosity to learn more.Written by a brilliant young scholar, Lashon HaKodesh: History, Holiness, & Hebrew is ground - breaking, intriguing, and remarkable.

Rabbi Cohen has the rare gift of being able to take complex topics and make them understandable without talking down to the reader. Even more remarkably, he can, in the same volume, steer the layman through the maze of Halacha while enriching the scholar's understanding of the background issues and halachic sources, logic, and debates.In The Laws of Daily Living: The Three Weeks, Tisha B'Av, and Other FastsRabbi Cohen examines one of the most important - and surely the saddest - times of the Jewish year, when the Jewish People mourn the loss of the Temple and the Exile that followed. In his clear and authoritative manner he examines the laws of all the fast days (with the exception of Yom Kippur), the restrictions of the Three Weeks, the heightened sense of loss that builds up as we approach the Nine Days, and the climactic mourning of the Tishah B'Av fast.
The book is enriched and deepened by a discussion of the historical background of the momentous events that led to the Temple's destruction, based on the teachings of the author's grandfather, the renowned Rabbi Avigdor Miller zt'l. This adds a new and important dimension to the way we mark this period. With the best of intentions, it is not easy to mourn something that we never knew and hardly understand. Rabbi Miller's thought provides a moving and profound discussion of the Beis HaMikdash, its role in our lives, and the all - consuming loss that the Jewish People suffered with its destruction. Those who truly mourn the loss of the Temple, say our Sages, are destined to rejoice in its rebuilding. As we study and learn to properly follow the laws of these sad weeks, we bring that long - awaited moment ever closer.

A comprehensive halachic guide to the laws and practices of the Festivals.A Compendium of Practical HalachahRabbi Simcha Bunim Cohen
 has earned a niche in countless family libraries through his clear, thorough, and practical works on Halachah. His many books on the laws of Shabbos and child-rearing have become standard texts - enlightening, authoritative, and accessible - for scholar and layman alike.Now he turns his spotlight on an area that is in need of his unique clarity. The Yom Tov laws are a grey area, so to speak, because many of the Shabbos labors are permitted - but under limited circumstances. What are the circumstances? What are the limitations? What labors are sometimes permitted? Which are never of ""Yom Tov need"" permitted? May one always carry? What deg is sufficient to permit the labors that are sometimes permitted? Is one ever permitted to prepare food for the next day? The list of questions is long and perplexing.As always, Rabbi Cohen deals with the forest before turning to the trees. He explains the principles and parameters so that the reader has a clear understanding of the rules. Only then does he turn to specific cases. And, as is his forte, he deals with current situations, the sort of utensils and cases that one will not find spelled out clearly in the classic works of Halachah.A sefer such as this provides refreshing proof that the Torah is timeless, because the principles of every situation can be found in the Talmud and the codes - provided one has the background and understanding to find and apply them. Rabbi Cohen does, in full measure.This is a work that belongs in every Jewish home, alongside Rabbi Cohen's other works: The Shabbos Home, The Radiance of Shabbos, The Sanctity of Shabbos, The Shabbos Kitchen, and Children in Halachah.

Let My Nation Ascend continues where Let My Nation Wander left off, bringing to life the Jewish people's ascent toward their ultimate destination of the Promised Land. 
 
 
 
 With the tragedies of the spies and Korach long behind them, the Jewish people's final year in the wilderness is filled with new challenges as well as tests of their faith in Hashem. They are faced with trials and tribulations from nature, with the disappearance of Miriam's Well and their subsequent thirst; from animals, in the form of serpents; and from man, beginning with the warring giants, Sichon, king of the Emorites, and Og, king of Bashan. They must overcome their old nemesis, Bilam, and fight against Midian. And they will have to part from Moshe and accept Yehoshua as their new leader.
 
 
 
 Once again, Rabbi Yosef Deutsch brings events portrayed in the Chumash to life with his inimitable style and vivid prose, using Talmudic and Midrashic sources to deftly add context and detail. Questions and apparent contradictions are resolved in light of the teachings of Chazal, the Rishonim and the Acharonim. Let My Nation Ascend completes the story of the Jewish people's journey to Eretz Yisrael, affording us a behind - the - scenes understanding of events. As with every volume in the series, this knowledge enriches our emunah, and instills pride in our holy ancestors' heroism, as well as empathy with their challenges.

As the textbook lesson in G-d's constant, though unobtrusive vigilance and protection of His people, the miracle of Purim is the Jew's wellspring of faith in times of exile and danger. Let us not forget that it was the first exile after more than eight centuries in Eretz Yisrael, and bewildered Jews wondered if Hashem had cast them off for good! Then came the climax - the proof that miracles take place beneath the surface and that the bonds connecting G-d and His people can never be cut.Megillas Esther tells only part of the story. The rest is in the Talmud, Midrash, and the classic commentators. If we could only pull all the disparate sources together into one flowing, coherent whole, we would have not only an absorbing and inspiring lesson in faith, we would enter the spine - tingling world of Mordechai and Esther - the intrigues of the royal court, the Machiavellian swamp of Haman's conspiracy, the thousands of talents of silver tumbling from Haman's hands to purchase the rights to history's first genocide, the bravery of Jewish children unafraid of death. We would exult with Mordechai on the royal steed, led through the streets of Shushan by his arch - enemy. Our hearts would pound as the uninvited Esther risks her life to plead with Ahasuerus - and succeeds!Yosef Deutsch puts us on the scene. He has accomplished the very impressive feat of canvassing all the sources and retelling the Purim story like a spellbinding novel - except that every word is true! In his narrative, the events come alive for us as never before. Every reader on every level will enjoy this book as a fascinating story and as a great learning experience. For the scholar, the author provides copious sources. For the rest of us, he gives the story of the Megillah with a sweep and level of interest that we have never experienced before.Read this book. You'll enjoy. You'll learn. You'll love it!

When Hashem created the world, He would not send the rains until there was a person on this earth who would appreciate this gift and and be grateful for it. Adam prayed for rain. It fell. Trees and vegetation grew. And Adam thanked Hashem. It was necessary, as soon as man was created, to teach him the lesson of gratitude - because gratitude makes all the difference between a life that is happy and fulfilling, and one that is sad and bitter.
In his three decades of teaching, his pioneering work in founding and directing Ohr Naavah, and his lectures heard around the globe, Rabbi Zechariah Wallerstein has met, spoken with, and counseled thousands of men and women. He heard their stories, discussed their challenges, and helped them find solutions to their problems.

And he realized that the root of many of our problems, both personal and societal, come from one root cause - a lack of hakaras hatov, of gratitude.

Being grateful for our blessings, for favors bestowed on us by others or by Hashem, stands at the core of all relationships; indeed, hakaras hatov is the core of Creation itself. Gratitude enables us to see the world with warm and loving eyes, to keep our relationships with family and friends fresh and vibrant, to serve Hashem with sincere joy. And lack of gratitude? It leads to bitterness, anger, conflict and unhappiness.

Let There Be Rain, by Rabbi Wallerstein with bestselling author Rabbi Shimon Finkelman, combines Torah wisdom with marvelous stories to show us how to incorporate hakaras hatov into our thoughts, hearts and actions. It offers a daily reading that includes an informative Torah insight and an inspiring story to illustrate the concept.

Over the past decade, tens of thousands of Jews incorporated daily study of shemiras halashon into their days; they refined their speech and changed their lives. Now we are offered still another transformative opportunity: to make hakaras hatov the cornerstone of our lives, and to make those lives rich with meaning and happiness.

So open Let There Be Rain and make it part of your day. You'll be thankful you did.

Daily wisdom on how to live in peace with family friends and yourselfIt's all we really want, and when we think about our life and our world, we realize that shalom - peace - is all we really need. No matter what we have or don't have, no matter what we're going through, if we're at peace with ourselves and those around us, we can thrive.Nevertheless, each person is a world unto himself, and those worlds sometimes collide. Is there any way to build and protect the shalom that is so vital to our spiritual, emotional and material success?The Torah's wisdom overflows with insight and practical answers to this burning question. Live the Blessing brings the reader a daily dose of this wisdom, accompanied by a story that shows us how to incorporate the concept into our lives. Its chapters candidly confront the nitty-gritty of conflict and machlokes, including parent-child relationships, shalom bayis, divorce, business and community disputes. Its vital message: While differences are inevitable, personal enmity is not.This volume is packed with practical tools and expert advice. Each lesson suggests a step that readers can take to infuse their lives with shalom. Each chapter includes an interview with a rabbi, mental health professional or educator who provides an expert's perspective. The final chapter is a collection of materials that provide invaluable tools for securing the blessing of shalom for a lifetime.With one concise, content-packed lesson each day, this volume will transform the readers' perspectives and their lives, providing a realistic way to Live the Blessing that shalom brings.

Powerful stories and insightsto bring chessedinto our everyday livesChessed. It's in your hands. (And in your smile. Andmouth. And feet. And in countless other ways.)From the Talmud to the Rambam to the Chofetz Chaim - andmany other Torah sources - we learn how to deal with even themost challenging and turbulent times: la'asok b'Torah v'chessed. Tobusy ourselves with Torah learning and performing acts of chessed,kindness, to others.Of course, we all try to be ""nice"" to others, but to fill our daysand nights with chessed? Many of us imagine that to be the task ofthe great men and women who head up the organizations, createthe gemachs, raise the millions to feed and clothe the impoverished.But while that is certainly vital, Living Chessed shows us how we""ordinary"" people can also be ""gedolim in chessed"" - just by grabbingthe countless opportunities to help our fellow Jews.In Living Chessed, Rabbi Avrohom Asher Makovsky shareswith us many Torah sources that talk about chessed, inspirationalinsights and guidance and, above all, stories of how chessed - evensomething small - can transform the lives of both the one givingand the one receiving the chessed. In brief, readable chapters, wewill discover the best segulah of all - not hurting someone's feelings.We will read about how the Tzemach Tzedek ""opened"" the gatesof heaven - by racing home to help another Jew in business. Howa man fulfilled his dream of having children by opening a free-loangemach. We will enjoy - and learn from! - story after story of peoplewho took the opportunity to help someone, often with something assimple as a compliment or even just a smile.
Living Chessed will show us how we can, indeed, ""live chessed""throughout our days, enriching the lives of others. And enriching ourown lives as well.

Achieving A Life of Serenity Through FaithMore stories. More insights. More emunah! And a much, much happier life!With more than 150,000 copies of the Living Emunah series now in print, countless men and women have discovered how to deal successfully with life's challenges and enrich their lives through emunah, faith in Hashem and His infinite goodness. Living Emunah 4 helps bring our emunah to an even higher level, with more Torah insights and more true stories about the power of emunah in our lives. Here is the amazing truth about emunah: the more you believe in Hashem's ability to help the more you will see that help in your own life. Even more the stronger your belief, the better you can deal with whatever He sends you, in good times and hard ones.When we read about the father and son whose emunah stayed firm even when the doctors despaired our emunah is strengthened. When we see a mother who waited thirty years for her prayers to be answered, and never lost her faith we are given tools that help us wait for our own personal salvation. The message of the Living Emunah series, which continues in Living Emunah 4, and which has made it so wildly popular is: Happiness is possible. Serenity is possible. Actually, nothing is impossible - when you empower yourself with emunah.

Achieving a life of severity through faithWith almost 200,000 copies in print, the Living Emunah series has taken so many of us on a wondrous journey towards spiritual growth, serenity, tranquility, and strength. On a journey to emunah.
Emunah - faith in Hashem, in His goodness and His Providence - is what enables us to truly appreciate our blessings in good times, and to deal with difficulties and obstacles in times of challenge. But though the benefits of sharing our sorrows with Hashem are obvious, it's not always simple for us to tap into our faith. And that's where the Living Emunah series comes in. With its stories of emunah, its Torah insights and clear, practical suggestions, Living Emunah gently shows us how to move our faith from our minds to our hearts and to our everyday lives.This volume was written in the shadow of one of the modern the Covid-19 pandemic that took world's greatest challenges so many lives and put millions of people into a frightening lockdown. In a special section, Living Emunah author Rabbi David Ashear shows us how the power of emunah can support and guide us, even in these dark times when we feel utterly powerless.Like the rest of the Living Emunah series, Living Emunah 5 shows us how to ""live emunah,"" so we can replace despair with hope and fear with confidence.SPECIAL SECTION Chizuk for the challenging COVID-19 crisis

Is it the strength it givesthem to face their challenges with patience and faith?Yes, the extraordinary success of the Living Emunah series - withmore than 300,000 copies in print - is due to all those reasons, andmore. For its many readers have discovered that when they ""live emunah""their lives are enriched, their relationships are improved, and, mostimportant, their connection to Hashem is incomparably strengthened.And there are the stories. So many stories. The businessman whowent from needing charity funds for his family's food to giving outthousands of dollars to the poor - in less than a year. The rabbi whowent to the ""wrong"" hospital - at exactly the ""right time."" The family thatchose the path of emunah and gratitude, and saw what could have beena disastrous weekend turn into a wonderful and memorable vacation.When we ""live emunah,"" problems turn into challenges, challengesmorph into opportunities, and opportunities become the foundation forlives of joy and tranquility.

Serenity. Hope. Strength: The world of Living Emunah.Why have literally hundreds of thousands of people made the LivingEmunah series an important - and beloved - part of their lives? Isit the serenity that they feel, when they read stories of Hashem's infinitechesed to His People? Is it the hope that envelops them, when they learnto truly feel that Hashem is watching over them? Is it the strength it givesthem to face their challenges with patience and faith?Yes, the extraordinary success of the Living Emunah series - withmore than 300,000 copies in print - is due to all those reasons, andmore. For its many readers have discovered that when they ""live emunah""their lives are enriched, their relationships are improved, and, mostimportant, their connection to Hashem is incomparably strengthened.And there are the stories. So many stories. The businessman whowent from needing charity funds for his family's food to giving outthousands of dollars to the poor - in less than a year. The rabbi whowent to the ""wrong"" hospital - at exactly the ""right time."" The family thatchose the path of emunah and gratitude, and saw what could have beena disastrous weekend turn into a wonderful and memorable vacation.When we ""live emunah,"" problems turn into challenges, challengesmorph into opportunities, and opportunities become the foundation forlives of joy and tranquility.

There is so much to discover in the story of Esther and Mordechai and Haman's genocidal plot against the Jews. For centuries commentators have pored over the words of Megillas Esther, creating a rich treasury of explanation. Megillas Esther: The Answer Is...draws upon these commentaries, helping us uncover the depth of meaning in the Megillah's words, and giving us a unique perspective on the world - changing events taking place in Shushan.
In Megillas Esther: The Answer Is...we read the words of the Megillah together with the Alshich, Maharal, Vilna Gaon, Chassidic masters, Rav Chaim Kanievsky, and dozens more - over seventy commentaries, from Talmudic times and through today.
Why did Vashti refuse to appear during the party? What really lay behind Bigsan and Seresh's attempt to assassinate the king? What was the significance of Achashverosh's signet ring? Why did Mordechai refuse to bow, thus endangering his people? Why did Haman turn to Esther for clemency? Important questions, all of these, and the commentators' many answers give us a new understanding of the Purim story.
One of the most vital themes of Megillas Esther is the idea of hashgachah pratis, Divine Providence. In addition to the questions and answers, Megillas Esther: The Answer Is...features a unique look at""Divine Providence in Motion, "" in which we get to peek""backstage"" at how G-d quietly intervened in Shushan's complex world to ensure Jewish survival and victory.
Wondering how to make your Purim even more meaningful? Here's a quick answer: Read through the questions and answers of Megillas Esther: The Answer Is...and begin to truly comprehend the greatness of Purim's hidden miracles.

Perspectives FromThe World of Special Needs
Special voices, special stories,in a very special book.Everyone who knew him was mesmerized by Saadya Ehrenpreis a""h, theyoung man with Down syndrome who confounded all the experts. He wouldbe totally dependent for every basic need, the doctors predicted; he had little orno chance of ever communicating. Yet Saadya developed into a man who couldread in Hebrew and English, traveled by himself to learn in Eretz Yisrael, andattended the Makor College Experience program at Yeshiva University.After his untimely passing from COVID-19, his mother, Ahava Ehrenpreis,a talented author, chose to memorialize his life through filling a pressing need- providing a book that would serve as both a resource and an inspiration toparents, relatives, friends, and professionals dealing with children and adults whohave special needs. More: To compile a book for everyone who believes thatevery person is special and should be treated with understanding, compassion,acceptance, and respect.
More Than Special is that book – a book for those who want to deepenand expand their own ahavas Yisrael. And doesn't that mean all of us?
More Than Special includes:The authentic, honest, and heroic voices of parents who give us agreater understanding of the challenges - and miracles - of raisingspecial-needs childrenAdvice from social workers and experts in the field of special educationon how to create opportunities for individuals with special needsGuidance in legal and financial safeguards for special-needs childrenand adultsRabbanim discussing halachic and hashkafic issues of the special-needspopulation, including poignant and heartfelt words of chizuk from RavMoshe Shapiro and the Pnei Menachem

My Essence Is Tefillah is an adaptation of thehighly popular, two-volume sefer, Ani Tefillah,written by Rav Binyamin Zev Shisha. Thisbeautiful sefer focuses on the importance of tefillah andkedushas beis haknesses in an extremely comprehensivemanner. Chock-full of gems from the ba'alei mussar andother Torah sources, both Chassidishe and Litvishe, thebook also includes hundreds of stories of tzaddikim toillustrate various concepts.Readers will find a detailed discussion of the morningpreparations for tefillah, followed by an examinationof the different parts of the tefillos themselves and thesignificance of the shul, the place that is designated fordavening. Other chapters discuss tefillah b'kavanah indepth; the great advantages of tefillah b'tzibbur; thepower of ""amen""; and much more.Based on the enthusiasticfeedback garnered by theHebrew and Yiddisheditions of this book,our hope is that MyEssence Is Tefillahwill serve as aninvaluable guideto all those who wishto grow in their avodashatefillah and pour outtheir hearts before Hashemwith meaning and passion.

Thirty-three individuals share theirpersonal encounters with the Rebbe
From the homesick twelve-year-old to the presidential advisor; the budding artist to the mother who is struggling to make ends meet, My Story 2: Lives Changed features thirty-three inspirational true stories of the Rebbe from the My Encounter with the Rebbe oral history project. These stories are complemented by family photos and documents, as well as a stunning selection of portraits of the Rebbe from the Living Archive picture collection.
From the book...""I'll tell you what your difficulty is,"" the Rebbe said to me. ""You think that human interaction is like a chemical reaction.... But people aren't chemicals. When people interact, the result is a nuclear reaction!""RABBI DAVID LAPIN
""Other people were telling me the opposite - that if I did not decide soon, I would forever regret that I had walked away from my soulmate. Instead, the Rebbe advised that I should take a break from dating. Perhaps after a break, things would become more clear for me. But the most important thing he said was, ""It all depends on you.""MRS. DEVORAH KLAR
""When the audience came to an end, he said, ""Please keep me informed about your mother's situation."" And being the eighteen-year-old wise guy that I was, I shot back with, “Are you just saying that, or do you really want to hear from me?"" He answered, ""I would never say something I didn't mean.""MR. CHARLES S. RAMAT

The Glory of An Exalted Prayer, Through Commentary, Insight, and Inspiration
""The soul of every living being will bless Your Name, Hashem, our God...""It is one of the most beautiful and beloved of our prayers...
""...Who guides His world with kindness and His creatures with mercy...""...a passionate and lyrical declarationof praise and thanksgiving...
""..To You alone, we give thanks..""...a tefillah that unlocks the inner gates of gratitude andreverence, which itself opens up new sources of blessing.

Rabbi Yisroel Besser gives us a whole new understanding of the magnificent words of Nishmas, the ancient prayer of praise and thanksgiving. He draws upon classic and contemporary commentators and shares dozens of stories that illustrate the many concepts discussed in Nishmas.There is so much to discover in this short and powerful prayer. Why does Hashem want our praise; indeed, how dare we mortals praise the Divine? What kind of joy and connection can we find in times of darkness and concealment? How do we truly feel the flow of Hashem's compassion - and how do we thank Him for it?In Nishmas: Song of the Soul, Rabbi Besser shows us how these holy words can touch our hearts - and send our souls soaring.

Ideas, Insights,And Inspirations FromRabbi Berel Wein
Rabbi Berel Wein is known throughout the Jewishworld as an esteemed Rav and posek, witty speaker, seasonedauthor, and noted historian. His words of wisdom, anecdotes,and vignettes attract overflow crowds, whatever the venue.Rabbi Wein has published numerous volumes aboutJewish history, Jewish values, contemporary Jewish living,and musings and reflections. However, this is the first time acollection of his actual lectures has been published in English.Some of these lectures were delivered in Yeshiva ShaareiTorah to the students of the yeshiva. Others were given invarious forums over the years. What unites them all is RabbiWein's ability to present poignant lifelong Torah values andlessons in a dynamic and engaging manner.Reading these timeless talks will take you on a delightfuljourney - back to the past... on the way to eternity!Rabbi Staum has done more than justice to many of thethoughts that I expressed in my lectures and has collectedand edited them for this book. I am gratified that he hasdone so and I hope and am confident that the book will findresonance and meaning to those who read and study it.RABBI BEREL WEIN

Or do you know it?In the kaleidoscope of belief systems that color this world, ours is unique in that it is not really a belief system at all; rather, it is a compilation of knowledge, solid as granite, supported by evidence, clear as glass.In Now I Know, Rabbi Avrohom Katz, prolific author (Designer World, Our Amazing World, and Our Wondrous World) and noted menahel of Beis Chaya Rochel Seminary in Gateshead, England, takes us by the hand and leads us on a literary expedition beginning at the dawn of our nation. Through the crucible that was Egypt, continuing on to the Giving of the Torah at Sinai and beyond, we explore evidence of the Almighty's existence and omnipotence.For, as Rabbi Katz so poignantly illustrates, Hashem is our loving Father Who wants for us nothing less than the peace of mind born of clear convictions; the serenity of knowing that the cause we are dedicating our lives to is the truth. That is why He stamped proof all over our long history- both in the bitter and the sweet- throughout His commandments, and even on our very bodies.And you will know today.

An Emunah OverviewOn Every Part Of Maggid
""We gather together, on this night, to commemorate our exodus from Egypt into Hashem's embrace, thus becoming His nation and His servants till the end of time. We discuss, in detail, all the suffering that we endured in Mitzrayim, all the miracles Hashem did, and all the gratitude we have to Him for doing all this for us. We are expected to get into such detail that we can actually experience it ourselves, on this night, as if it were all happening to us, and to reach the level of joy and gratitude that the Jewish people had at the time of our exodus. This is supposed to bring us to a heightened level of emunah that will infuse our service of Hashem throughout the year.""...Therefore, I have written this Sefer, to serve as an emunah primer for the Haggadah. To make the concepts of emunah readily available so that those leading the seder on this night can easily access them and share them with their family, which will inspire ourselves and, in turn, our children, in the joy of being a Yid.""- Excerpt from Introduction
""The thrust of this commentary is to show how the basic theme of the Seder night is to show our emunah in, and our gratitude to, Hashem for our physical and spiritual redemption. Every section of the Haggadah is elaborated on in this manner, and at the end of each section a short, to-the-point synopsis of the commentary is presented, to guide one's fulﬁllment of the mitzvah of Sippur Yetzias Mitzrayim ""On This Night"".Rabbi Zev Leff Shlit""a
""...Great and important to add clarity in the foundations of emunah in a way that can be easily taken to heart... Cannot overemphasize the importance of strengthening these matters of emunah...""Rav Chaim Stein Zt""l

""I am certain that those who read it will have spiritual pleasure and a bright light in understanding the words of the author of the Haggadah.""Rabbi Gabriel Cohen Shlit""a

Their world is pure and idealistic, and their goals are spiritual. Their success is measured in the thrill of a new insight and the glimpses of Hashem's wisdom that only the Talmud can reveal. For some, the early years are only the beginning of a life - long ascent in the world of Torah. For most, however, a return trip to the material world is inevitable.This is one of the most difficult transitions a Ben Torah ever will make. It calls his entire identity and purpose into question. And yet little time is devoted to preparing for this transition in the years during which all energy is focused on Torah learning. Some get lost, and some feel misled; most are confused about how to proceed with their self - esteem and values intact.Rabbi Aaron Lopiansky has written a book that will serve as a guiding light to the many young men who are making this transition. He puts the Jew's ever - evolving life mission into clear perspective, helping readers plot a path of growth and elevation that will sustain them for the decades to come. He helps them cull the everlasting lessons they will take with them from their yeshiva years and ensure that these lessons translate cogently into their lives in business or a profession. This book is a groundbreaking addition to any Torah library and a lifeline for any young man taking his first tenuous steps outside the protective walls of yeshiva.

Jonathan Rosenblum is a people person.These one hundred portraits describe thosewho had a great impact on his life -most unheralded outside their family andcommunity, some world famous; mostof whom he knew personally, some onlythrough researching their lives.
I am frequently asked: ""How do I know what my mission in life is?""The answer is: Hashem sends each person opportunities to theirdoorstep. Usually we don't respond because the task does not seemglamorous enough, or it is too hard, or for any number of otherreasons.
Yonoson Rosenblum has an incredible eye for searching outexceptional people disguised as ordinary ones. These people do notseek fame or glory; they simply respond to the tasks that Hashem setsbefore them.
It takes Yonoson's sharp eye to spot these people, and his beautifulpen to convey their extraordinary accomplishments, while maintainingthe guise of their ordinariness.
May he inspire readers to seize the opportunities presented to eachof us to be great in his or her own fashion.- Rav Ahron Shraga LopianskyRosh Yeshiva of Yeshiva of Greater Washington
If the wise man is one who learns something from each individual heencounters, Jonathan Rosenblum is wise indeed. In these incisiveportraits, he masterfully captures the most exceptional and admirablequalities of a wide range of men and women, both renowned and""ordinary."" In doing so, he challenges each of us to cultivate theseexemplary qualities within ourselves.- Professor Moshe KoppelDepartment of Computer Science, Bar Ilan Universityand author of Judaism Straight Up

Rebbetzin Sara MurikLeading with Love, Teaching with Joy
How did she do it?How did she do it?How did Rebbetzin Sara Murik - the beloved, larger-than-life""Morah Murik"" - live a life of such vast accomplishment andoverflowing love? How did she care for thousands - and for everyindividual Jew? How did a little Yerushalmi girl become one ofAmerica's most renowned Bais Yaakov educators?Proudly wearing her school uniform, like every other Bais Yaakovgirl under her care, Morah Murik rarely walked. ""Our Morah inUniform"" raced and danced and sang through the corridors of theschools she founded, first in Chicago and later in Lakewood.For Morah Murik, no task was too small: Though principal of theschool, she would wash the floors in the absence of the janitor.And no challenge was too large - not even the daunting task offounding a brand new school at the age of 70.How did she do it? Through the 7 simple words that definedher life:
I Love Hashem ... And Hashem Loves Me!Empowered by Hashem's love for her, she in turn had anoverflowing love for His people. She was a joyous and creativeeducator, not afraid to discipline, but always with compassionand caring. Now, even after her passing, Morah Murik continuesher life's work through this absorbing, engaging biography, stillteaching us to feel the strength of Hashem's love for us, andhelping us return that love to Him and to His children.

The Travel Letters of Rabbi Ovadiah of Bartenura Written Between 1488-1490 During His Journey To The Holy LandThe name of Rabbi Ovadiah of Bartenura is familiar to every Torah student. His classic commentary is the key to the understanding of the Mishnah and is the constant companion of all those who study Mishnayos. But as his letters reveal, he was also an intrepid traveller who exposed himself to the dangers of disease and pirates in order to live in the Holy City of Jerusalem. In the late fifteenth century, Jerusalem was at one of its lowest points, depleted by war, plague and rapacious authorities. Rabbi Ovadiah's arrival brought hope and encouragement to the existing communities and gradually attracted newcomers, many of them Italian Jews who sought to be his students. One of these students is the author of the final letter in this volume. Thanks to a promise made to his father to describe all the communities he visited, we have a remarkable record of the Jewish communities of Italy, Greece and Egypt, as well as those of Eretz Yisrael. These travel letters, originally published in Hebrew under the title Darkei Zion, are now presented in English, for the first time, in a lucid and highly readable translation entitled Pathway to Jerusalem. It is one of the most valuable historical sources for the period, as well as a very interesting book for the lay reader. The bravery and dedication of Rabbi Ovadiah of Bartenura and his contemporaries makes for fascinating and inspirational reading. Translated by Yaakov Dovid Shulman

Profound Advice For A Successful LifeIn our fast-paced and complicated world, a person often has little time to search for the urgent answers to life's most pressing questions. Due to a lack of scholarship or time, an individual is challenged by personal circumstances, an adversarial culture, and rapidly changing science and technology. Having a lucid, systematic, and authentic Torah response to these daunting issues is an asset whose value is immeasurable. This is the gift that Rabbi Eliezer Papo z""l (5546-5588) (1786-1828) gave to the Jewish people.

The tale we tell tonight lays the foundations of our emuna and avodas Hashem for the entire year. It has the power to invigorate our avodas Hashem and make the Jewish faith a living reality, for ourselves and our children.But how can we find new meaning in a story we already know? Many of us search through stacks of Haggados for insights that will add depth to our Seder experience. Without realizing it, we lose sight of the story itself, and its life-changing messages escape us.
The Pesach Haggadah: Living Our History shows us that the meaning we search for lies in the words of the Haggadah themselves. It reveals the hidden depth of the story we thought we knew, and shows its personal relevance to the life of every Jew.Rabbi Reuven Leuchter, a prominent disciple of Rabbi Shlomo Wolbe zt""l, is one of the leading educators and baalei mussar of our generation. Rabbi Leuchter has served as Mashgiach in several yeshivos. Today, he heads a kollel for budding scholars, and delivers shiurim and mussar ""vaadim"" throughout Israel and abroad. In addition, he trains future rabbis for rabbinic or kiruv careers with Ner Le'Elef.

Thoughts and ideas on the Haggadah, Yetzias Mitzrayim,and the halachos and minhagim of the Seder fromRabbi Chaim Yisroel BelskyRabbi Chaim Yisroel Belsky was a brilliant Rosh Yeshivah and posekwho used his astonishingly broad mastery in all areas to plumbthe depths of Torah knowledge. Many thousands were proud to callthemselves his talmidim. Now you too can become one of Rav Belsky'stalmidim.Drawing upon both his shiurim and the insights he would share at hisown Seder table, Pesach With Rav Belsky weaves together fascinatingdivrei Torah and halachic rulings about the Seder, background on theHaggadah text itself and Chazal's teachings on Pesach, together withpractical lessons and guidance on how to make our Seder table lively,reverent, and meaningful. His brilliant advice on chinuch is relevant notonly for the Seder but all year long.How can the ""leader"" of the Seder bring the story of YetziasMitzrayim to life? What are the parameters of the mitzvah of SippurYetzias Mitzrayim - and what is the objective of this unique com-mandment? What were the challenges facing the Jews as they leftthe Egyptian culture in which they had been entrenched, and howdid they become Hashem's people? How can we use the mitzvos ofLeil HaSeder to come closer to Hashem? Pesach With Rav Belsky willenable the reader to fulfill the Haggadah's injunction that at the Sederone must see himself as if he personally went out of Egypt.Read this sefer before the Seder, and come prepared with unusualinsights to share. Read it during the Seder and enhance the conversa-tion and everyone's understanding of the Haggadah. And, yes, read itall through Pesach, and discover a whole new way to appreciate thegreatness of this beloved holiday

Biblical History, Egypt And The Missing MillenniumWho was Pharaoh of the Bible?A COMMON SCHOLARLY IDENTIFICATION for the Pharaoh of the Exodus is that of Ramesses the Great, from the 19th Dynasty of Egyptian kings. This is primarily based on the verse in Exodus 1:11 that describes the Israelites building the store-city of Ramesses during their years of oppression.HOWEVER, THIS IDENTIFICATION POSES PROBLEMS. It does not fit in with the number of years stipulated by the Bible between the Exodus and the construction of the Second Temple by Darius the Great, the Persian monarch and ruler of the 27th Dynasty in Egypt. Furthermore, over the last couple of decades, archaeologists and researchers have uncovered a wealth of evidence contradicting this identification.ANOTHER BAFFLING PROBLEM that traditional Jewish dating sets the beginning of the Egyptian Dynastic era at circa 2000 BCE, the painstaking conventional chronologists yields a date of whereas analysis of circa 3000 BCE.In this fascinating study, bestselling author Rabbi Alexander Hool (The Challenge of Jewish History, Mosaica Press, 2014, and Searching for Sinai, Mosaica Press, 2017) draws on fascinating research from many different disciplines as well as startling astronomical evidence to establish the convergence of a new Egyptian chronology in line with traditional Jewish dating.In addition, the path of investigation yields a surprising and penetrating insight into the setting of the Exodus, and this results in the contraction of Egyptian history by-incredibly-almost a thousand years!

Stories on the SiddurTo Bring Your Tefillos Alive
Prayer. That unique form of communication between us and our Creator; the connection that brings us close to Him while simultaneously effecting our own yeshuos.But prayer doesn't always come naturally to us, especially when we have a hard time understanding or relating to the tefillos. Portraits of Prayer's goal is to change that.In this second volume of Portraits of Prayer, the tefillos of Birchos Krias Shema through Shemoneh Esrei, as well as the tefillos after Shemoneh Esrei, are explored and beautifully explained. Fascinating and inspiring stories abound throughout the pages, bringing to life the verses from the siddur that we say each day, and helping us see the relevance of these words to our own reality.As with Volume 1 of this highly-in-demand series, you'll find yourself turning to Portraits of Prayer frequently as a way to connect to your tefillos...and to your Father in Heaven.HASHEM GAVE RAV ELIEZER ABISH a tremendous zechus; he has accomplished a wonderful thing.  After the Beis Hamikdosh was destroyed, we weren't able to bring korbanos anymore, but Hashem said that tefillos are more precious to Him than korbanos. What a wonderful zechus he has to present the tefillos in a way that is appealing to people, thereby assisting them to appreciate their davening.-Harav Gamliel Rabinovitch, Rosh Hayeshivah, Yeshivah Hamekubalim Sha'ar Hashamayim, YerushalayimIT IS CRITICAL for our generation that people enjoy their davening; that they understand and find deep meaning in their tefillos. We can be sure that this work will leave a strong impression on all who have the pleasure to read and learn from it.-Harav Yitzchok Sorotzkin, Rosh Hayeshivah, Telz, Mesivta of Lakewood

Shemiras eiynayim? Kedushah? They are fantastic concepts - for tzaddikim. But for me? The first thing you should know is: You can do this. The second thing you should know is: You will be much, much happier.With hundreds of thousands of copies in print, The Chofetz Chaim: A Lesson a Day taught us how to make shemiras halashon an integral part of our lives. ,Now the Chofetz Chaim Heritage Foundation, which produced A Lesson a Day, shows us that shemiras eiynayim, even in today's world - especially in today's world - is both vital and doable.These daily readings pack a powerful punch. They're short, illuminating, practical, often funny, and always right on target.What is kedushah and how do we acquire it? What is the single most effective way of avoiding temptations? What factors make it harder to ""just say no""? Positive Vision offers strategies and insights based solidly on Torah hashkafah combined with a deep understanding of the challenges we face in today's world.In the past years Klal Yisrael learned that guarding our tongue leads to innumerable benefits in our personal and communal lives. Now, with the help of these daily readings, we'll enrich every facet of our lives. And, yes, we'll learn to tap into the kedushah that is the birthright of every Jew.

Practical Wisdom For Positive LivingInspired By The Life And Teachingsof The Lubavitcher RebbeTHROUGH A MIX OF NATURE, nurture, social conditioningand free will, we each possess a personalized lens thatframes, forms, clouds and distorts the way we see ourselves andthe world around us. In order to live in the most meaningfuland effective way possible, each of us needs to continuallyassess and adjust the default frames we have developed.In Positivity Bias, we learn that life is essentially good; thatpositive perception is applicable and accessible to all; thatit derives from objective, rational insight, not subjective,wishful imagination, and that positive living is a matter ofchoice, not circumstance.An inspiring and life-enriching tapestry woven fromhundreds of stories, letter, anecdotes, and vignettes -Positivity Bias highlights how the Lubavitcher Rebbe, RabbiMenachem M. Schneerson, of righteous memory, consideredthe most influential rabbi in modern history, taught us to seeourselves, others, and the world around us.

 You've just finished a tasty Shabbos repast surrounded by your loved ones. Or, you've come to the conclusion of a delicious barbecue with your best friends together at the table. And now, you want to appreciatively express your thanks to Hashem. So you announce, ""Let's Bentch!"" But, do we really do justice to the Biblical expression of bentching? The Chofetz Chaim assures us the rewards for bentching are grand! He reveals that if we bentch correctly we will be blessed with a livelihood of plenty and dignity all of our days.
 
 Rabbi Moshe Meir Weiss takes us on a journey through the familiar pathways of bentching and reveals to us many hidden gems lurking behind the familiar words we chant every day. So much of our communication with Hashem is done when we are in a rush. But, when we sit back after a pleasant dessert at our tables, we can indulge, with Rabbi Weiss's help, in some serious connectivity with our Creator. Rabbi Weiss shows us how we are not just thanking Hashem for our food but also for our clothing, our homes, our digestive systems, our modern conveniences and much, much more. He explains the connections between our food and Eretz Yisroel, the linkage between our meals, the Torah, and family unity.
 
 There is something in this remarkable sefer for everyone, scholar and novice alike. This new hardcover edition is enhanced with outtakes on every other page to spark family conversations and introspections. One of the challenges of Torah study is the problem of retention since we have very little time to dedicate to review. The beauty of embarking on the study of bentching is that we can review Rabbi Weiss°ªs lessons over and over every time we bentch. Rabbi Weiss, with meticulous research, explains to us meanings behind every single word in the bentching. For example, he shows us the subtle differences between such words as""re'einu, zuneinu, parnaseinu, v'chalkileinu.""
 
 As Yehudim (of which the root word means""to thank""), we are the People who specialize in giving thanks. With this treasured sefer, we will indeed become talented at this vital art. Then, the next time we bentch, Hashem will say, ""I see you really appreciate it. It's a pleasure doing business with you. I will shower you with even more of My Divine largesse."" So, come join us for a journey with Rabbi Moshe Meir Weiss, one that will enhance your tables, and your lives, for many years to come.

 On the one hand, Purim commemorates and celebrates the miracle that Hashem performed for the Jewish People at the time. In this retrospective sense, it""faces backwards."" 
 On the other hand, however, it also""faces forwards"" in the sense that it provides a vision toward the future. It contains many messages that reveal extremely profound concepts and fundamental truths... the festival of Purim is a time when these ideas can be encountered, accessed, and absorbed anew.
 Ultimately, these two different""directions"" do not conflict with each other, for the day of Purim is not just a historical event; it is an ongoing presence in the Jewish calendar and in its national experience.
 Behind the feasting and merriment which accompany the day of Purim lie some of the most profound and meaningful ideas of Judaism. Drawing on a fascinating array of sources, renowned teacher and author Rabbi Immanuel Bernstein (author of the bestselling Teshuva, Aggadah, and Darkness to Destiny Haggadah) guides the reader on an eye - opening journey towards a deeper appreciation of the Jewish people's most Multicolor festival.
Approbations:
""It is known that the festival of Purim is both concealed and exalted, its laws and customs are hidden and mystifying. In this unique sefer, the author explains the essence of the day as well as the avodah which accompanies it.""
- Harav Osher Weiss
 
""I thank you for this major contribution to the appreciation of Purim... I urge everyone to make use of this tool to enhance the Purim Day.""
- Harav Yisroel Reisman

The lectures were initially hosted by gracious mosdos, and beginning in 1975, when the Rav's kehillah moved to Flatbush, were conducted in Rabbi Miller's own Bais Yisroel Torah Center on Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn. Many have remarked that after attending or listening to recordings of only perhaps ten or fifteen lectures, their perspective on life was forever changed. These remarks are attributed not only to baalei teshuva, but more frequently to frum men and women whose eyes were opened for the first time in their lives. At the end of each lecture, questions were usually first accepted on the subject. Next, Rabbi Miller would, incredibly, accept questions on any subject. Excluded only were specific points of halacha. Few rabbis of stature have been so bold. But the Rav had so great a command and understanding of the great truths, and the need to share that understanding with those who anxiously wanted to know was so compelling, that he was willing to make this offer. Questions were accepted from the floor, or, if you wished, you could anonymously write your question on a slip of paper and pass it up to the front. This option was also available to ladies seated in the Ezras Noshim.

*And By Obnoxious I Mean Really Smart and Insightful, Just Like You.Over the last twenty years I've had a chance to work with all sorts of teens from all parts of the Jewish community and I've noticed that they all have very similar questions. In some places those questions are encouraged and discussed openly. In some places those questions are whispered and hidden. I hope you have at least one adult you can speak to with your questions. Questions are good! The whole process of learning Torah is based on questions! If you're not asking questions then how do we know if you're really engaged in what we're doing? And not asking the questions out loud doesn't make the questions go away. It makes them roll around in your head until they make quite the racket. Sometimes teens don't ask because they think their questions are so powerful that if they got out the whole system of Torah will crumble under the weight of the question. Well, wonderful and important teenager, that is wholly unlikely.So this book is about questions teens like to ask. We'll try to explore some thinking on the big topics: davening, faith, working with parents that are complicated, Hashem, Torah, the purpose of life, that sort of thing. Maybe you'll like my answers. Maybe you'll have more questions. That's great. Ask them. You deserve really great answers. You are, after all, the most important thing in all of creation.Okay, let's jump right in. Who's got a question?

Virtually every decision we make is affected by our grasp of the principles of emunah and bitachon (faith and trust in Hashem). But where do we turn to gain clarity about these issues, to find answers to our many questions?

Rav Avigdor Miller, zt""l, answered that need for thousands of Jews, and more than a decade after his passing, he continues to do so. Rav Miller left behind a vast legacy of recorded shiurim and writings. Now, thanks to the efforts of Rabbi Yaakov Astor, an important part of that legacy has been transformed into this monumental book.

The themes of emunah and bitachon permeated a great many of Rav Miller's shiurim and seforim, but the material was scattered in many different places and was thus hard to access. Now, that eye-opening material has been collected, assembled and organized into a fascinating question-and-answer book, a book that will answer your questions and bring you clarity when you need it most. Rav Miller's bold, straightforward approach sheds a brilliant light on the most troubling, thorny issues that confront us. His crystal clear Torah wisdom will profoundly impact your life.

And now we can invite Rabbi Frand to join us at the Seder, with this engaging and thought - provoking Haggadah commentary.
 
 Pesach night, as Rabbi Frand tells us, is more than just a commemoration of a major event in our history. The goal of the Seder is to strengthen us in our emunah, inspire us in our observance, and give us a deeper and closer relationship to Hashem. It's the goal of the night - and the goal of this Haggadah
 


How do the words zecher l'Yetzias Mitzrayim, encapsulate all Jewish belief? 

How do the four cups teach us to be passionate about our lives? 

What is the eternal message of the matzah?
 In his warm and witty style, Rabbi Frand offers us the answers to these and so many other questions. And these are answers that will enhance and even transform our Seder - and, yes, our lives.

Ramban (Nachmanides) Rabbi Moshe ben Nachman, who lived in 13th - century Spain, was one of the greatest minds in an epoch of great men. He was a leader, a thinker, a Torah and Talmud commentator, a halachic decisor, a successful defender of Judaism against the Church and its Jewish apostates.

The Story of the life of MaranHagaon Reb Yaakov YisroelKanievsi, Zatzal
...At length they reached the border, an empty open field with watchposts on either side with soldiers waiting to shoot at the slightest suspicion of movement in the silence. They crossed this field as quietly as they could, without any idea where they were going, hoping that the guide they had hired knew what he was doing.
Suddenly the line of bochurim stopped. Their hearts stood still.
What's going on?"" someone asked.
""Sh--Sh!"" came the answer from up and down the line.
From the dampness in the air it seemed like they were near some body of water. If they listened closely they could hear the rippling sound of a river.
They started moving again. Within a few moments they crossed to the other side and were quickly swallowed up into the thick tangle of a forest.
Now the tension grew even greater. Any cough or sneeze, any groan of fatigue or sound of pain from a stubbed toe had to be stifled, however much it hurt them...
The Steipler dragged his tired feet along behind, trying to follow another bochur in the darkness. His thoughts were wrapped up in a passage from the Gemara and this gave him strength and comfort...
In this way the night passed, slowly and painfully, and so did part of the next day. When Mincha time arrived he found a place by a tree and davened, oblivious to the occasional shots and the constant fear of death... He davened with such absorption that he did not notice that the others in his group had moved on and left him completely alone, with no idea of where he was...Such was the incredible devotion of the Steipler Gaon, zatzal, to Torah and mitzvos, a sense of devotion so total that it enabled him to concentrate his energies solely on the service of Hashem, day in day out, oblivious to whatever circumstances he found himself in. RAMPART OF FIRE tells the remarkable story of the life of this tzaddik.

Hamburger', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Categories_Biographies & Memoirs']","[{'name': 'Title', 'position': 1, 'values': ['Default Title']}]",Rav Avigdor Miller,"The first and only comprehensive biography of a truly unique Gadol!

When Rav Avigdor Miller left was niftar on 27 Nissan 5761 (2001), he left behind a radically transformed Torah world - a world he helped revolutionize. Surprisingly, he did so without almost ever leaving the confines of his little shul in Brooklyn.


Despite being born in early twentieth century America, attending public school, and growing up in an environment focused solely on materialism and assimilation, Rav Miller somehow managed to resist the powerful tides of his youth. The path of hatshgachah - a reflection of his own determination to serve Hashem with all his heart - took him to the Yeshivah Eitz Chaim in New York, to the legendary Slabodka yeshivah in Europe, to Chelsea, Massachusetts, to serve as Rav, to Mesivta Rabbeinu Chaim Berlin as Mashgiach, and finally to East Flatbush and later Flatbush as the Rav of a small kehillah.


Along that path, he never stopped working on himself, and he never stopped learning and teaching Torah. One thought at a time, one small action at a time, Rav Miller transformed himself into a supreme eved Hashem. One word at a time, one shiur at a time, Rav Miller transformed virtually every Jew who came in contact with him. His mind-expanding, eye-opening Thursday night lectures - disseminated around the world through his tape recordings - changed the lives of Jews everywhere. His patient, methodical Gemara shiurim turned those who at first could only read from a siddur into accomplished talmidei chachamim. His numerous published books enriched readers with the gift of refreshing clarity as they conveyed hard-hitting, no-nonsense Torah hashkafah.


The story of Rav Miller's life - presented here for the first time in a fascinating, comprehensive biography - is a testimony to the power we all have to transform ourselves, and our world. Rav Avigdor Miller's shiurim on Simchas Hachaim Publishing


This book is a labor of love by a devoted talmid. Although it is a comprehensive biography, it didn't begin that way. It began as a collection of aneCDotes about Rav Miller that demonstrated how the lessons he taught in his mussar vaadim were ""living lessons"" - what he called his ""program for life."" To the small groups of b'nei Torah who attended his vaadim, Rav Miller actually revealed the system that helped him become a gadol.


That small collection of aneCDotes ultimately grew into this comprehensive work. But its unusual origin sheds light on what sets it apart. It paints an astonishing picture of how a revolutionary gadol B'Yisrael developed from humble beginnings through myriad tiny steps. It is thus a testimony and, even more so, a guidebook to how real transformation occurs....

Live life on a whole new level!We live in a world where our soul-instincts are dulled by the common culture. Creeping materialism and non-Torah values slip into our consciousness without us even realizing it, robbing us of a tangible belief in the World to Come. As Rav Miller explains, the main attack of the yetzer hara is on our belief in Olam Haba.This book - a collection of Rav Miller's teachings on the topic of Olam Haba - is an attempt to correct that, to restore Jewish belief in Olam Haba to its rightful place. Belief in Olam Haba is the pinnacle of our emunah, right alongside belief in Hashem Himself, as Rav Miller often explained.A profound feeling of emunah in Hashem and Olam Haba can help us face the challenges of everyday life - including its highs and lows, victories and frustrations - with a calmness and seriousness otherwise unattainable.This book is a journey that can change you forever - and for the better.

And the list goes on. Rav Yisroel Belsky was all of these and much, much more. He was brilliant beyond description and was fluent not only in all of Torah but in the sciences and other fields of worldly knowledge - and he applied that knowledge to Torah and psak Halacha. As senior Posek for OU Kosher, his vast knowledge of Jewish law, combined with his deep understanding of food technology, impacted every kosher consumer - but all of this does not define Rav Belsky's greatness.
 
 In this riveting and carefully researched biography, we will learn of Rav Belsky's incomparable passion for learning and teaching Torah, his burning desire to share Hashem's greatness with others. We will be moved by story after story of how he connected with generations of talmidim both at Mesivta Torah Vodaath where he was Rosh HaYeshivah and at Camp Agudah, where he served as Mara D'Asra.
 
 We will be inspired by the selfless hachnasas orchim of Rav and Rebbetzin Belsky, of his dedication to the mitzvah of Tzedakah, of his willingness to extend himself on behalf of total strangers, if only he could make anothers Jew's life a bit brighter.
 
 Rabbi Shimon Finkelman a talmid of Rav Belsky, shares with us shares with us story after story about this towering Torah personality. We meet him as a brilliant youngster and later as a camp counselor, learning Mishnayos between pitches as he umpires a baseball game.
 
 We see him at a turning point of his life, as he defers and ultimately declines a prestigious scholarship in order to learn Torah. We see him with his talmidim. With gedolei hador. With campers, young and old. With Jews who have emigrated from the former Soviet Union. With Klal Yisrael, whom he loved so deeply.
 
 Rav Belsky is the unforgettable biography of a truly unforgettable gadol baTorah.

It is seder night, and at the head of the table sits Rav Chaim Kanievsky shlita. He shares a vort, discusses a halachic question, unveils an insight. Behind him you can dimly make out other figures, surrounded by an aura of holiness, who also contribute to the seder conversation: Rav Chaim's father, the Steipler zt'l, and his uncle, the Chazon Ish zt'l. The legendary Rebbetzin Kanievsky z'l, her eyes glowing with joy, is there too.What a seder that would be...
Though obviously we cannot attend that imaginary seder in Bnei Brak, we can share Rav Chaim's thoughts and wisdom on the Haggadah and discover some of the practices he follows. In a sense, we can participate in Rav Chaim's seder - as we avidly read through the Rav Chaim Kanievsky Haggadah.
One of the most revered Torah personalities of our time, scion of a great Torah family, Rav Chaim Kanievsky has touched hundreds of thousands through his sefarim, his berachos, and his very presence. The Rav Chaim Kanievsky Haggadah presents his insights and weaves them together with scores of stories and aneCDotes to make this a work that is engaging and unique.
Open the pages of this unique Haggadah and prepare to see the seder through the eyes of Rav Chaim Kanievsky shlita.

Comments, Stories, and PerspectivesWhat does Shemittah have to do with you? A lot more than you think!You're not a farmer. You may not live in Eretz Yisrael. Yet the lessons of Shemittah - lessons of emunah and bitachon - can profoundly affect you. And the power of Shemittah - the power, among other blessings, to hasten the Geulah - belongs to all of us, as we study the halachos and incorporate the messages of Shemittah into our lives. Join Rav Chaim Kanievsky shlita to connect with this once-in-7-years mitzvah.
Rav Chaim Kanievsky on Shemittah includes:
The hashkafah, reasons, and lessons to be learned from the mitzvah of Shemittah, including finding the proper balance between emunah and hishtadlus

Inspiring stories of Shemittah observance
Selected halachos of Shemittah based on the piskei halachah of the Chazon Ish and Rav Chaim
Special feature: The nine mitzvos of Shemittah, from The Schottenstein Edition Sefer HaChinuch, The Book of Mitzvos


As Rav Chaim himself said, in his sefer Derech Emunah: ""In the merit of the mitzvah of Shemittah we will be redeemed, as the Gemara states (Sanhedrin 97a) that on Motza'ei Shevi'is (the year after Shemittah) the Jewish people will be redeemed from exile. The Chazon Ish explained this to mean that if we observe Shemittah properly, we will merit being redeemed after Shemittah.""So let's learn the halachos, read the stories, get the inspiration - and help bring redemption.

Comments, Perspectives, And Stories

Imagine... davening with Rav Chaim Kanievsky at your side If you ever merited to see Rav Chaim Kanievsky zt'l praying, you felt your own tefillos, your prayers, grow more fervent, more heart-filled, more real. We can no longer see his face shining with holiness - but we can still be inspired, both by his own insights into the words of the Siddur and related stories about Rav Chaim and his illustrious family.
Rav Chaim on Tefillah, which was prepared for print right before his passing, includes insights on the words and themes of the Shabbos prayers shared directly by Rav Chaim and collected from his extensive writings, as well as dozens of stories about Rav Chaim, his beloved wife Rebbetzin Kanievsky, and his illustrious family. Compiled by Rabbi Shai Graucher, who was an almost-daily visitor to R' Chaim's home, this is a work that will bring your davening to a whole new level.

Rav and founder of Machon Maggid Harakiah in Cedarhurst, NY, Rabbi Daniel Glatstein is one of the contemporary Jewish world’s most popular speakers and respected maggidei shiur. In this unique work, he treats the Haggadah text not as a series of unconnected “vertlach,” but as a living, unified document, mirroring the slavery, miracles, and ultimate liberation in its words and structure.The Rabbi Daniel Glatstein Haggadah features comprehensive analyses on never before tackled subjects such as, ""Who Wrote the Haggadah?"", ""What Is The Structure of The Haggadah?"", ""How Many Words In the Haggadah?"" and many other basic issues that give us a deeper understanding of our beloved Haggadah, and, indeed, of the entire experience of Yetziyas Mitzrayim.

A life of lovefor Torah and talmidimHe was a self-made man. Yes, he came from a princely family of Torahgreatness. Yes, he was endowed with superb intellect. But perhaps it canbe said that Rav Elya Meir Sorotzkin soared to greatness despite these uniquequalities, not because of them! Because his was a life of constant growth.The fact that he was gifted never stopped him from trying even harder.As a young bachur, he understood that he would only be able to truly growIn Torah away from his home in Telshe Cleveland. Only when he was justanother talmid, not the son of the Rosh Yeshivah. Nothing could stop him, nothomesickness, not a different culture, nothing. Rather, his challenges built him.That is the person you will meet in this book, Rav Elya Meir Sorotzkin.He became a rosh yeshivah at a very young age and, with ""blood, sweat,and tears,"" as he would often say, built the yeshivah into one of America'spremier institutions. More: He built individual talmidim. Because he personallywent through the painstaking process of self-discovery and growth, he wasable to identify with the struggles and triumphs of his talmidim in a way thatfew could.The last years of life were akin to a flame that burns increasingly brightbefore it is extinguished. Nothing could stop him from carrying on with hislife's mission of learning and teaching Torah, transmitting Torah In its purityand splendor to his talmidim.His body was battered. His doctors viewed his ability to continue deliveringhis shiur until the last day that he was conscious as a medical miracle.It wasn't.It was a culmination of a life of ratzon, of willpower, of never letting thephysical get in the way of the spiritual.This book will give you a deep appreciation for Torah. It will show you whata lifelong impact a rebbi can have on his talmidim and later their wives andchildren too. On every page there is an inspiring story with which any readercan identify.This book will elevate you, inspire you... and obligate you.

Attended public school in Baltimore. Knew only one blatt Gemara at his Bar Mitzvah. Was this a Jewishly deprived American youngster?Not at all. It was the world renowned gaon and rosh yeshiva Harav Mordechai Gifter, Rosh Yeshivah of Telz and one of the world's greatest Torah scholars and revered leaders!
In this warm and aneCDote - filled biography, Rabbi Yechiel Spero introduces us to one of the most fascinating Torah giants of recent times. Rabbi Spero's best - selling""Touched by..."" series has earned him many thousands of admiring readers. In this, his first biography, he outdoes himself.
To Rav Gifter, every minute of Torah was a precious gift. His intense and successful effort to master the Torah was phenomenal. All his life he carried with him - and personified - the memories of his mentors and his years in the Telz Yeshivah in Lithuania. He was a peerless orator, who moved listeners to tears and inspired them to scale heights. He had an awesome sense of responsibility to the yeshivah, the community, and even to the youngest talmid and most humble petitioner - he made time for everyone. Most of all, he loved Torah. It was his life's goal - and his contagious zeal for learning created legions of talmidei chachamim in his image.
He interacted with the greatest sages of the era and was a fearless champion in the intellectual battles for the truth of Torah. And he was tender and understanding with the Jewishly unlearned US Navy veteran who stumbled into Telz, and the college girl searching for an Orthodox prayer experience. Students were awed by his intensity, but warmed by his tender and loving embrace.
He described himself as a""simple melamed"" a teacher. His mission was to master Torah and transmit it in all its grandeur. He succeeded.
The book is lavishly illustrated, including many never - before published photographs. And it is filled with Rav Gifter's ideals, teachings, perspectives, and classic orations, in his own words.
When he was a teenager, his wall was adorned with pictures of Torah giants - and there was one empty frame with the words""What about you? "" The youngster from Portsmouth answered the question with his own magnificent life.
Read about him. You'll be thrilled and your aspirations will be elevated.

Brief and Brilliant: ""Notes"" From the MashgiachHe was known simply as ""the Mashgiach."" As mashgiach ruchani of Bais Medrash Govoha, the Lakewood Yeshivah, for close to half a century, Rav Nosson Wachtfogel worked beside Rav Aharon Kotler, zt'l, helping to build the yeshivah and, indeed, to build Torah Jewry in America after the Holocaust. And, of course, to build young men, thousands and thousands of them, into Bnei Torah.""When a person learns mussar, it should bring him to great simchah... If someone learns mussar and then becomes sad and depressed, it means that he learned it wrong!""Leket Reshimos -- literally, Collected Notes -- are collections of short and brilliant nuggets of inspiration assembled by Rav Wachtfogel's students, who heard them directly from Rav Wachtfogel himself. Leket Reshimos also include his students' memories of the Mashgiach and his inspirational life and service of Hashem, as well as stories Rav Wachtfogel told them about his own illustrious rebbeim.On Rosh Hashanah, even the smallest person can become a complete tzaddik. He can change his situation, he can change who he is, and truly become a complete tzaddik.Rav Nosson Wachtfogel on Elul and Yamim Noraim is adapted from Leket Reshimos. Most of the ""notes"" are brief, some only a paragraph or two, yet they contain an infinite amount of wisdom and perception. You're just a pipeline - whatever Hashem sends you each moment, that's all you have. This attitude saves a person from imagining he has anything and thinking highly of himself. It also gives him amazing hope for the future because it means that he's standing right next to the Borei Olam.So read a ""note."" Think about it. Savor it. Discuss it. Think some more. And you will find that you have enriched this awe-filled time of year. And, yes, you've enriched your life as well.

The Life and Leadership of the Kamenitzer Rosh Yeshivah
He was a gadol who lived and breathed Torah learning. A member of Eretz Yisrael's Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah. A master educator who influenced literally thousands of talmidim, from pre-schoolers to respected mechanchim. He was a close confidante of Rav Elyashiv, and part of a family that included some of the greatest names in pre-war Europe.And it all started in a public school in Pittsburgh.R' Yitzchak Scheiner's journey from a Pittsburgh high school to his simple Yerushalmi home and the hallowed halls of Kamenitz Yeshivah is a story of breathtaking hashgachah pratis. It is a story, also, of the dedicated people who enabled the budding math and Latin scholar to become a gadol b'Torah. His parents, who defied the odds and lived a Torah-observant life in a time and place where that was exceptionally rare. The meshulach who visited the Scheiner home and told his astonished parents that yes, there were yeshivahs even in America. His rabbanim: R' Shraga Feivel Mendelovitch, R' Shloime Heiman, and R' Reuven Grozovsky. And the rebbe he never met but learned so much from: Rav Baruch Ber Leibowitz, ""der zeide"" whose granddaughter he married, and whose illustrious legacy he carried on for almost eighty years.Based on dozens of interviews with talmidim, mechanchim, and family members, Rabbi Nachman Seltzer paints a vivid and absorbing portrait of Rav Scheiner as an incomparable mechanech, a loving father to his own children and his talmidim, a man of incredible sensitivity and integrity.By his teachings and personal example, Rav Yitzchok Scheiner influenced many thousands. Now, with the publication of this biography, he continues to teach - and inspire - all of us with his shining example of gadlus.

Comments, laws, customs, stories and perspectivesfrom Rabbi Aharon Yehudah Leib ShteinmanCompiled byRabbi Avraham Yeshayahu Shteinman

Don't we all love the simchah of Purim? The children’s excitement, the dancing and singing of yeshivah boys, the feelings of unity and friendship that surrounds us, no matter what our age or stage.In a simple little apartment in Bnei Brak, home of R' Aharon Leib Shteinman, the Purim simchah reached still another level, one even more profound, elevated and enduring. This was the simchah of Torah learning and emunah, of connecting to Hashem and seeing Him in every aspect of our lives.This is the kind of simchah you will find in the pages of Reb Aharon Leib on Purim and Megillas Esther.Compiled by Reb Aharon Leib's grandson R' Avraham Yeshayhahu Shteinman, Reb Aharon Leib on Purim and Megillas Esther includes:
Insights on Parashas Zachor and our obligation to destroy Amalek
The full text of Megillas Esther, with commentary based on R' Aharon Leib's insights and writings, as well as those of other gedolim such as the Chazon Ish, Rav Shach, the Ponovezher Rav, and R' Chaim Kanievsky (who is the author’s maternal grandfather)
A selection of R' Aharon Leib's Purim customs and halachic rulings
""Purim at the Shteinman Home"" - memories from family and talmidim of what Purim was like in the Shteinman home
Stories about R' Aharon Leib's incredible devotion to Torah, and his remarkable lifestyle
R' Shteinman's teachings on how to be happy all the time.
No, we can no longer visit that holy apartment on Rechov Chazon Ish, but as you read through the pages of Reb Aharon Leib on Purim and Megillas Esther, you will find yourself enveloped in the wisdom, practices, and sheer gadlus of some of the greatest Torah leaders of our time.

The Life and Legacy of Rabbi Dovid Feinstein
Reb Dovid Feinstein was born to one of the greatest 
poskeiha'dor
 of his time, Rav Moshe Feinstein zt'l, and he himself

was a phenomenal 
masmid
 and 
ilui
. Yet Reb Dovid carried

his incomparable 
yichus
 and many accomplishments lightly,

with a sweetness and humility that only emphasized his Torah

greatness.
He was a quiet man, content to sit and learn day and night

in the MTJ 
beis medrash
 that was his second home for eight

decades. And yet, with the 
achrayus
 for the Klal that also

defined him, he taught and influenced thousands, beloved by
talmidim
 and virtual strangers alike for his compassion, deep

understanding of human nature, and his gentle smile.
He was, as one of America’s leading roshei yeshivah said of

him, a man who was 
""kulo Torah""
 - whose essence was Torah.

""Kulo Torah"" included care and consideration for others – the

ability to understand the needs of the 
talmidim
 who were so

drawn to him, of petitioners who came to him pleading for
tefillos
 and 
berachos
, of shoppers who stopped him in grocery

store aisles with halachic questions, and of his people, his

neighbors and friends on his beloved Lower East Side.
Reb Dovid
 is a book about the many aspects of Torah

greatness that a person can achieve. A book that helps us

achieve greatness as well.

More than a name, it was a guarantee, a promise, an invitation
HE WAS A TZADDIK - and Kerestirer a place to which Yidden were drawn with invisible cords of love and hope. He resolved unsolvable problems, healed the incurably ill, and warmed souls numb with cold. In that small town, fiery Chassidim found truth, and hungry travelers found nourishment. The Rebbe - who labored in Torah, poured out his heart in prayer, and seemed to exist in a realm of his own between heaven and earth - would stop everything if a Jew needed a cold drink or warm bed, would cease his holy toil to help another. He belonged to the people, and they to him. A generation loved and revered the tzaddik of Kerestir, and they transmitted this veneration to their children, who in turn passed it down to their children.
Today, more than ninety years after the passing of Reb Shayele, his stories, image, and teachings still serve as a source of blessing and healing to multitudes. Thousands converge on his burial place each year on his yahrtzeit, and those connecting with his ideals and message feel the force of his merit accompanying them. The Hebrew - language volume, Moifes HaDor, was a novelty: pulsating with emunas tzaddikim, well researched and precise as an academic journal.
Within months of its release, a new printing was needed, and then another. The Yiddish language version best - seller was greeted with similar enthusiasm, sold - out in record time to a readership eager to hear about the tzaddik, to own a book which is itself a source of blessing.
This is the first English - language work to tell the story: like the town itself, you will not leave the same as you arrived. You will be ushered into the peaceful town on the banks of the Bodrog River, moved by tales of hospitality and kindness, awed by the extraordinary that was ordinary in Kerestir - and just as then - blessed by a connection to this tzaddik.

Reb Eytan hasgifted Klal Yisroel with a remarkable and brilliant work that uplifted and inspiredme immeasurably, and will inevitably do the same for Yidden the world over.""-Harav Eytan Feiner, Rav of Cong, Kneseth Israel, Far Rockaway, New York

It details the role of the bas Yisroel in this worldwide endeavor.Rabbi Pesach Eliyahu Falk wrote:Rising Above aims to strengthen the Jewish woman in her role of actualizing the Torah's charge: ""You are a holy people to Hashem.""It is our hope that Rising Above will succeed in bolstering the Jewish woman's pride in all that pertains to the sanctity of our holy nation.Rabbi Zev Leff wrote:This book ""Rising Above"" is the women's companion to the book fór men, ""Veha'eir Eineinu Enlighten Our Eyes"" by the same author.

They long for a real connection to the Holy Land, but sometimes they lack the ability to feel that bond. The stones of the Kosel seem cold and hard to some; the streets of Yerushalayim, ordinary. Even those who can sense Eretz Yisrael's spiritual power often thirst for a deeper, more meaningful relationship with the land.What is the nature of the kedushah of Eretz Yisrael? How can we be inspired by it? How can we - as tourists, as students learning for a year or more, or even as residents in Eretz Yisrael - take advantage of the great opportunity of being in Hashem's beloved land? Sacred Soil, by Harav Moshe Wolfson shlita, a revered Torah leader of our generation, examines the spiritual riches of Eretz Yisrael and its mekomos ha'kedoshim.Join Rav Wolfson on a tour of Yerushalayim's spiritual essence. Understand the secret of the Kosel's eternity, discover the hidden message that Mearas HaMachpelah whispers to every Jew. Learn why Rachel is buried apart from Yaakov and how this should affect our prayers at her burial site. Experience the ecstasy of Miron, hear the song of Yam Kinneres, and connect to the Arizal in the elevated mountains of Tzefas. Appreciate the power of tefilah at the burial site of Chana and Shmuel HaNavi, be surprised at Yam HaMelach, learn an important lesson from Shimon Hatzaddik and hear the prayer of Yaakov for our generation at the tomb of Shimshon HaGibbor.Whether you are traveling to Eretz Yisrael for a short trip, a year - or even a lifetime - make sure to pack Sacred Soil with you, to ensure that you understand, and feel, the kedushah of this land that is like no other.

It contains the stories, the moral and ethical lessons, the ideas of our faith and our religion. In the Aggadah, we meet the wise and holy Sages of the Talmud not only as masters of the law, but as masters of the human experience.Compiled in the 16th century, Ein Yaakov is a classic collection of all the Aggadic material found in Talmud Bavli and Talmud Yerushalmi. For many centuries it has been among the most popular of Talmudic works. Many shuls had Ein Yaakov classes, in which, after long days at work, men drew inspiration from the holy teachings, parables, stories and lessons contained in Ein Yaakov and its commentaries. Our Rabbis understood the workings of man and taught us lessons that are still relevant today.
The Schottenstein Edition of Ein Yaakov includes many features that will enhance the study of this beloved classic:

Conversations with Rav Shlomo Hoffman Talmid of Rav Isaac Sher and Confidant of Gedolei YisroelVolume One - Self Awareness And Dealing With Challenges
One day someone came to tell me that Rav Isaac had called me for a meeting. I presumed that it was some kind of a preliminary meeting for a shidduch, so I got my jacket and tie and went to his house. When I got there I saw that there was no one home but him.""Did the Rosh Yeshiva call me for a meeting?"" I asked.""Yes. I called you for a meeting with your yetzer haʼra,"" he answered.""Why does the Rosh Yeshiva think I have a yetzer ha'ra? I am keeping up with the learning schedule that the Rosh Yeshiva made for me. What am I doing wrong?""Rav Isaac answered, ""Don't be offended when I tell you that you have a yetzer ha'ra. We all have a yetzer ha'ra. The only question is how we deal with it.""


Rav Shlomo Hoffman zt""l was a student of Kthe Chevron Yeshiva seventy to eighty years ago. He was among those who established a close connection with Rav Isaac Sher zt""l, and merited to receive from him guidance in avodas Hashem, the understanding of the human nefesh, and the foundations of man's purpose in this world.Throughout his life, from a young age until his passing on Purim 5773, Rav Hoffman assist- ed those who were in need of professional men- tal health counseling. Gedolei Yisrael (foremost among them Rav Shach zt""l), Roshei Yeshiva, and school principals were greatly assisted by Rav Hoffman's advice and wisdom.In the last thirty years of his life, he agreed to the request of bnei Torah to give vaadim (private lectures) to small groups and individuals in matters of self-awareness, chinuch, and avodas Hashem. These vaadim were eventually organized and published under the title, Sichos im HaRav Shlomo Hoffman, the first volume in an upcoming series. The first half deals with anxiety over sin and failure. Rav Hoffman shows how to correct one's sins in a way that uplifts him and does not throw him into despair and misery. The second half deals with self-awareness of the kochos ha'nefesh.The responses received from across the Jewish world were phenomenal. Parents and educators, young and old, Torah scholars and laymen, mental health professionals and counselors - all enjoyed the unique depth of wisdom that Rav Shlomo had to share. Many commented that the sefer changed their outlook on life. It gave them new tools for education and for understanding the kochos ha'nefesh of their children and students.Now the English-speaking public can also be part of the amazing influence this sefer has had across the Torah world. Read and discover... the Secrets of the Soul.

How many sacrifices did the kohanim slaughter per minute during the bringing of the korban Pesach? What was the weather like during Krias Yam Suf? Pesach heralds a time of preparation - cleaning, scrubbing and cooking. Yet of greater importance is the spiritual preparation for the holiday, and the pivotal Seder night. For it is this holiday that establishes the core of our relationship with G-d. By bringing us out of Egypt and punishing the nation that had enslaved us, G-d demonstrated that we are His chosen children.Every father is obligated to teach this to his children, to impart these basics of our faith on the night of the Seder.""You shall relate in the ears of your child... that I made a mockery of Egypt and My miraculous signs that I placed among them, and you shall know that I am Hashem"" (Shemos 10:2). It is our obligation to teach our children the lessons learned from the Egyptians' punishments. Not only that Hashem punishes the wicked who mistreat His people - through the ten plagues, G-d demonstrated His dominion and sole control over the entire world.This book is designed to prepare the reader for this vital task. Step by step, it will take you through the Seder night, elaborate on the ten makkos, describe the suffering of our ancestors in Egypt, and rejoice in their ultimate redemption at the splitting of the sea. Complete with pictures that bring each part of the Seder to life, and a fascinating account of the bringing of the korban Pesach, it is the ultimate spiritual preparation for the Seder.

Transforming Our RelationshipWith Ourselves,With Others,And With HashemA Journey Through Sefiras Ha'omer And Beyond
Over a career spanning more than thirty years, Mrs. Juravel has built a stellar reputation as a therapist, Jewish educator, and internationally-renowned lecturer specializing in Torah perspectives on relationships - shalom bayis, parenting and bein adam l'chaveiro, generally... This book truly has the potential to be transformative. It will certainly elevate our Sefiras ha'Omer, but more importantly, it can permanently change our lives for the better, helping us all become joyous ovdei Hashem, who appreciate the fact that life may be full of challenges and difficulties, but that these are precisely the vehicles of growth and inner discovery we need.
RABBI YITZCHAK A. BREITOWITZRav, Kehillas Ohr Somayach

Mrs. Chani Juravel, a master educator, therapist, and spiritual mentor, has gifted us with a profound, yet practical, manual that will guide us through the days of the Omer. Sefirah in Our Lives is a wondrous journey to the most sacred place of all, our selves. Our real, cleansed, and sanctified selves. It is a journey well worth taking and this is a sefer well worth studying.
RABBI MOSHE WEINBERGERRav, Congregation Aish Kodesh of Woodmere

Each day of Sefiras ha'Omer resonates with a unique spiritual energy. Sefirah in Our Lives shows you how to capitalize on these privileged opportunities in order to transform your life and your relationships.DR. DAVID LIEBERMAN
I have just read Chani Juraveľ's Sefirah in Our Lives. I love the book; it has such real value. As she promises, it can change the way we relate to others and to ourselves.Nothing tells you more about living than life itself. Her true life examples are compelling and lead you toward a ""call to action"" - to look into your genuine options for making your life closer to what you would like it to be.TZIPORAH (HELLER) GOTTLIEB
This incredible book is a road map, day by day, to tap into the sefiros of the day and become bigger and better people.

Journey and DestinationWhy is the mindset (and indeed the obligation) of Shabbat rest,while that of the Festivals is joy? What is the relationshipbetween these widely differing modes of being and what dothey tell us about life?
Why is it customary to refer to an observant Jew as a ""ShomerShabbat"" (one who observes Shabbat) - why does Shabbat define theJew?
Why are the Festivals related to natural cycles (months or seasons)whereas Shabbat is not?
Why is Shabbat one of the Ten Commandments?
What is the ""Neshama Yetera,"" the ""Extra Soul"" of Shabbat?These are some of the questions addressed in this remarkable book.Shabbat is much more than a ""weekend,"" and the Festivals are muchmore than traditional celebrations of an ancient culture. This bookshows why.

The Depth and Beautyof Our Yom Tov TefillosEach month, we celebrate Rosh Chodesh. Three times a year, wecelebrate the shalosh regalim. But do we recognize the deep insightsthat lie bebind the deceptively simple prayers of these special days?

In his third volume on Shemoneh Esrei, Rabbi Zev Leff, renowned lecturer and educator, illuminates and analyzes the tefillos of Rosh Chodesh and yom tov. He develops and highlights the fundamental concepts underlying each word, demonstrating how the special days of our calendar underpin our uniqueness as a nation.While delving into the words of the Amidos, fundamental issues of our faith are explored:
Why was kiddush hachodesh the first mitzvah given to the Jewish nation as a whole?
What is the special connection of women to Rosh Chodesh?
How does the yom tov cycle renew our connection to Hashem and to His mitzvos?
Why do we mention galus in our yom tov Shemoneh Esrei?Doesn't that contradict the joy of the day?
The answers to these questions and many others will provide you with a clarity and depth that will transform your Rosh Chodesh and yom tov prayers.
On yom tov and Rosh Chodesh, we renew our connection withour Creator. Use this opportunity to enhance these special dayson our calendar - and in your life.
Rabbi Zev Leff has long been known for his ability to explain lofty concepts in a clear, tangible manner. Thousands have had their lives immeasurably enhanced by his incisive ideas, his sharp wit, and his crystal-clear hashkafos. Now you too can benefit from his wisdom.

Spare the Child - the English version of the Hebrew classic, אל תחטאו בילד - is the culmination of the illustrious chinuch career of Harav Yechiel Yaakovson, renowned for decades as one of the premier chinuch authorities in Eretz Yisrael. Urged into the field of chinuch by Rav Elazar Menachem Shach, and working for decades under the intimate guidance of Rav Shlomo Wolbe and Rav Aharon Leib Shteinman, Rav Yaakovson pioneered what have now become staples in the world of chinuch. In Spare the Child, Rav Yaakovson sets forth a crystal-clear package of the core principles of chinuch, relevant to every child at any age. More importantlyn besides providing day to day instruction, the book aims to create the mentality and personality of a mechanech.

A Personal Guide To MakingTefillah More MeaningfulOur most important relationship is not with our parents,not with our spouse, not with our siblings nor our children.

He lived long enough toperfect his masterpiece, but not to see it published. Thisbook is his legacy to the Jewish People - his gift to us.""A comprehensive, nearly encyclopedic sourcebook for all who wish toexpand their understanding of the Jewish prayer book... [will] enhanceand intensify [their] emotional connection to the prayer experience.""Rabbi Tzvi Hersh Weinreb

How Israel Is Using Sabotage,Cyberwarfare, Assassination -and Secret Diplomacy -to Stop a Nuclear Iran andCreate a New Middle EastPRAISE FORTARGET TEHRAN
""Target Tehran is more than a thrilling tale that combines intelligence operations. diplomacy, and espionage. It is a story that sheds fresh light and understanding on the threat from Iran and why it is vitally important to ensure that the theocratic dictatorship in Tehran does not gain access to the most destructive weapons on earth.""- Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster (USA-RET.), former U.S. National SecurityAdvisor and author of Battlegrounds: The Fight to Defend the Free World
""A remarkable story about the war against Iran's attempts to achieve military nuclear capability. While I cannot confirm the details presented in the book, it is no secret that Israel and its allies are engaged in a relentless fight to stop Iran, and the authors relate this struggle in a thrilling fashion, as well as discussing the important moves to develop relations with Muslim countries afraid of an Iranian bomb.""- Danny Yatom, former chief of Mossadand Member of Knesset (Labor)
""When I served as the head of Israeli military intelligence in 1995, the Israeli intelligence community estimated that if Iran moved forward with a success-oriented process toward a nuclear weapon, Iran would obtain the bomb within a decade. The campaign that has been carried out since the 1990s to prevent the Iranian regime from gaining a military nuclear capability has been mostly clandestine, chapters and individual episodes of which are described in Target Tehran.""- Oshe Ya'aon, former Israeli defenseminister and military chief
""Israel's covert campaign against Iran's nuclear program has gone on for nearly three decades. Drawing from a wealth of reliable sources, including esteemed intelligence officers, this compelling narrative offers a meticulously updated chronicle of Mossad's audacious undertakings aimed at impeding Iran's pursuit of nuclear weaponry.""- Uri Bar-Joseph, author of The Angel:The Egyptian Spy Who Saved Israel
""A must-read for fans of international affairs, espionage, and drama. Based on hard facts and intelligent commentary, the writers expose clandestine details about the most dangerous threat to humanity of our time: the relentless efforts of the clerical regime in Iran to develop and possess nuclear weapons in order to fulfill their radical Shia Islamist apocalyptic vision. A riveting page-turner that is both scary and hopeful at the same time.""- Danny Ayalon, former Israeli ambassador to the United States

When we eat them with this mindset,we begin our life-long journey of appreciating Hashem's kindliness andmaking it part of our avodas Hashem.Initially we leam to appreciate and thank Hashem for providing for usbeyond our basic needs. As Tosafos writes (Berachos 37a), Hashemcreated apples for us to enjoy.

Join Rav Miller as hedescribes his first encounter with an apple tree. Marvel with him as heexplores its remarkable properties.

A Guide For The Mind And Heart During Elul, Rosh Hashanah & Yom KippurThe days of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur have a hallowed place in the consciousness of the Jewish People. The sensitive soul approaches these days with a blend of anticipation and reverence, of hope and awe. We each have our own highlights in the prayers - moments that we identify with especially, and which strike a chord deep within. These are indeed special days. But they are also days that are sometimes not fully understood.The deeper and clearer our understanding of what is meant to happen during the Yamim Noraim, the more effectively we will be able to connect with the themes that run through these days and tap into their essence, receiving all they have to offer.If there is ever a time of year when it is absolutely crucial that the heart and mind work together, it is during the days of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. This deep, moving, erudite, philosophical, and highly original and inspirational work attunes our hearts and minds to these awe - inspiring days.

Why does the Haggadah place such emphasis on Rabbi Yehudah's three - word acronym of the Ten Plagues? These are a small sample of the queries and comments addressed in this fascinating commentary. 
 
 
 
 More works have been written on the Haggadah than almost any other book in Torah literature - and rightly so. Every Seder is enriched by the presence of commentary after commentary, insight after insight, interpretation after interpretation. With the publication of this edition, English readers who have difficulty with scholarly Hebrew commentaries can see for themselves why the Alshich is considered one of the greatest of Torah expositors and why his commentary ranks amongst the seventy authentic ways to understand Torah. The Alshich's multi - faceted commentary provides thought - provoking questions and comments, together with novel insights and answers, in ample measure.
 
 
 
Who was the Alshich?
 
 Rabbi Moshe Alshich (1508 - 1600), reverently referred to as HaAlshich HaKadosh (the Holy Alshich), was a dayan on the Tzefas Beis Din (Rabbinical Court) of Rabbi Yosef Caro, author of the Shulchan Aruch. He was also an early mentor of the Kabbalist Rabbi Chaim Vital. Although the Alshich wrote many halachic responsa, he is most noted for his Tanach commentary, based primarily on his regular Shabbos sermons. This monumental work has been hailed by more than four centuries of Torah scholars as one of the greatest expositions ever written on Scripture. In it, he expounds on complicated passages, answering fundamental questions of faith and Jewish belief. The Alshich uses his creative insight and his encyclopedic knowledge of Tanach, Talmud and Midrash to weave together his profound interpretations of Tanach. Studying Torah, Nevi'im and Kesuvim, by the bright light of the Alshich's commentary will warm the heart and illuminate the mind of every reader, from the nascent newcomer to the advanced talmid chacham. No less a personage than the Arizal, who would attend the Alshich's Shabbos derashos, described the Alshich's commentary as possessing?????????????????????????????????, one of just seventy authentic ways to understand Torah a rare accolade indeed.
 
 
 
From the Approbations
 
 Rabbi Avie Gold has masterfully selected and translated the Alshich's illuminating interpretations and deep insights of the verses in the Torah that refer to yetzias Mitzrayim and the Seder night. These have been written in a lucid, pleasing English and will undoubtedly augment and enhance the readers' concept and understanding of the Haggadah, thus enriching the Seder and Pesach experience overall. 
 
 -Dayan Menachem Gelley, Rosh London Beis Din / Rav of Beis Hamedrash Ohr Chodosh
 
 
 
 Studying the Haggadah as interpreted by the Alshich will shed new light on its lessons, and will illustrate how the holy words of Chazal have their foundations in the verses of Tanach, and will reveal the depth, beauty, and power of our traditions...This will undoubtedly enhance the English readers' understanding of the miracles of the Exodus... 
 
 -Rav Shmuel Kamenetsky Rosh Yeshiva, Talmudical Yeshiva of Philadelphia
 
 
 
 This work will be a vital aid to those to whom the Hebrew text is not an option. It will also aid those who can read the original, but to whom English is not their mother tongue, and it will help clarify and make the words of the Alshich even more alive and understandable.
 
 -Rabbi Zev Leff, Rav of Moshav Matityahu
 
 
 
 Rabbi Avie Gold has skillfully translated and presented the commentary of Rabbi Alshich to our English - speaking generation in this book. He has done so with faithfulness to the text and clarity and insight in its translation. This Haggadah is therefore worthy of being on one's Seder table, and its profound insights should provide for great discussion and intellectual stimulation on the holy night of Pesach.
 
 -Rabbi Berel Wein, Historian, author, and international lecturer

A Fresh Dissection of the RelationshipBetween Medicine, Medical History,& Rabbinic LiteratureWith a Foreword by Rabbi Dr. Avraham Steinberg 

In this novel and innovative work, Edward Reichman traces the medical understanding of anatomy, physiology, and therapeutics across time and genres of rabbinic literature. The accumulated literature of centuries of Jewish legal discourse on medical topics serves as the foundation for contemporary Jewish bioethics. As these writings span the chronological gamut of scientific and medical discovery, it is essential to view each source in its proper historical context. Marshalling a vast array of sources from multiple disciplines, Reichman demonstrates the importance of the historical dimension not only for medical halakhic research, but to better understand the unique relationship of Judaism and medicine throughout the centuries.""In his classic and vibrant style, Rabbi Dr. Edward Reichman has produced a masterpiece, integrating sources of halakha and medical history with the most recent medical advances. It is evident that Dr. Reichman's years of intensive research are now followed by his superb presentation of complex yet clear explanations of medical topics. The work is profusely annotated throughout with a multitude of halakhic, medical, and historical references. His scholarly and comprehensive discussions will prove invaluable to rabbis, physicians, and medical historians, as well as anyone wishing to gain an appreciation of the continuing achievements in the synthesis of halakha and modern medicine.""PROFESSOR FRED ROSNER, MDWorld-renowned expert in Jewish medical ethicsand Jewish medical history, author of numerous books,including Biomedical Ethics and Jewish Law

From what the simchah is about tothe various halachos and minhagim pertaining to it, this book will ensurethat you and your bar mitzvah boy are well prepared for this beautifulmilestone.How are we to understand the Chazal that a child first receives hisyetzer tov and - if he is zocheh to it - his neshamah as well, at his barmitzvah?Does one need to do anything different when celebrating a barmitzvah on a day other than the actual thirteenth birthday?• What is the significance of a bar mitzvah boy saying a pshetel?• Why does the father say ""Baruch Shepatrani,""and why is this brachah only said for a boy andnot for a girl?• What are the source and reasons for a barmitzvah boy to lein/receive an aliyah?• What are the halachic considerations to keepin mind when a bar mitzvah falls out at differenttimes throughout the year, such as Shabbos,Yamim Tovim, Sefirah, the Three Weeks, etc.?All of these questions and more are answeredin this comprehensive yet easy-to-read book,making it an essential read for every bar mitzvahboy and his parents.

How the Impossible Became Possible... on Schindler's List
""Much like The Boy In the Striped Pajamas or The Book Thief, "" this remarkable memoir from Leon Leyson, one of the youngest children to survive the Holocaust on Oskar Schindler's list, ""brings to readers a story of bravery and the fight for a chance to live"" (VOYA).This, the only memoir published by a former Schindler's list child, perfectly captures the innocence of a small boy who goes through the unthinkable. Leon Leyson (born Leib Lezjon) was only ten years old when the Nazis invaded Poland and his family was forced to relocate to the Krakow ghetto. With incredible luck, perseverance, and grit, Leyson was able to survive the sadism of the Nazis, including that of the demonic Amon Goeth, commandant of Plaszow, the concentration camp outside Krakow.Ultimately, it was the generosity and cunning of one man, Oskar Schindler, who saved Leon Leyson's life, and the lives of his mother, his father, and two of his four siblings, by adding their names to his list of workers in his factory-a list that became world renowned: Schindler's list.Told with an abundance of dignity and a remarkable lack of rancor and venom, The Boy on the Wooden Box is a legacy of hope, a memoir unlike anything you've ever read.

In addition to chapters depicting his greatness in Torah and his leadership qualities, much is written to portray his extensive efforts toward upholding traditional Torah values, including his battle against the Zionist authority's insistence on watered down Yiddishkeit and the establishment of a modern - day Sanhedrin. The last chapter chronicles Maran's final days, as well as his petirah and levayah.""The Brisker Rav"" series is unique in that it is not just a biography of the Brisker Rav, but rather contains stories that give the reader a flavor for the last hundred years of life in the chareidi world - the issues, the controversies, and the emergence of the vibrant chareidi community that exists today in the Land of Israel.

Stories, Parables, and Commentary on the Haggadah Based on the Writings of Rav Yisrael Meir Hakohen of RadinAlthough the Chafetz Chaim was on such a lofty level that we can't even fathom it, his teachings were extremely accessible. The Chafetz Chaim was known for his stories and parables, which pepper his sefarim and his many discourses, making penetrating lessons easier for anyone to understand.Rav Chaim Ozer Grodzensky, zt""l, said that the stories and parables of the Chafetz Chaim are like the mann that fell in the desert for Bnei Yisrael: just as every individual Jew was able to decide what his portion of mann should taste like, every individual today-man or woman, the very young or the aged- is able to glean an insight from the Chafetz Chaim's parables on his own level. A child appreciates a mashal because he enjoys a good story, and the talmid chacham appreciates the same mashal for the deep, penetrating lesson it imparts.This was one of the Chafetz Chaim's legacies to us: dozens of sefarim and discourses, in which he included hundreds of stories and parables to help us understand his teachings at our individual level.In his hesped for the Chafetz Chaim, Rav Moshe Landinsky, zt""l, the rosh yeshivah of Yeshivas Radin, pointed out how the train engine pulls a string of train cars behind it with great force. If the engine would suddenly be disconnected from the rest of the cars, they would continue moving simply by momentum. But how long will they continue moving without the engine there to pull them?The parables, stories, and teachings in The Chafetz Chaim Haggadah are meant to draw out the force of momentum a little longer. To shine a brilliant light on the darkness of our times and enlighten us with the insights and lessons the Chafetz Chaim left behind for us.We may not be able to fathom his level-but we can get an understanding of his teachings through his parables and stories. The Chafetz Chaim's own words and lessons come to life in these pages, giving us a glimpse of a gadol b'Yisrael from a generation past.

The Torah and Customs, Stories and Spirit ofRabbi Moshe Sofer of PressburgCapture his feelings of emunah and anticipation.Share his excitement and love for mitzvos.Feel his spirit at your Seder.
One of the greatest Torah sages of the 18th century, Rav Moshe Sofer, the Chasam Sofer, was a brilliant, compassionate, and fearless leader of Klal Yisrael. In this Haggadah, his voice speaks to us through the centuries, as relevant today as in his own turbulent times.
Yisroel Besser presents the Chasam Sofer's unique and timeless Torah in a contemporary and relatable way. Collected from the Chasam Sofer's extensive writings, these fascinating and unusual insights will bring a new inspirational excitement to the Seder. We will feel his longing for geulah, his profound understanding of the long exile, his joy at redemption.And we will read stories. So many stories. Stories told by the Chasam Sofer himself, stories told about him by his descendants and disciples. Parables and true tales, stories of miracles and of piety. Stories about slavery and freedom, about waiting and praying and never losing our faith.We will also explore his minhagim, the customs he practiced to mark Pesach, which will enrich and enhance our own holiday.""Even deep in this galus,"" the Chasam Sofer taught, ""we are promised that during the moments when we sit down and tell our children of Yetzias Mitzrayim... a Divine flow is showered onto us, as on the night we left Mitzrayim."" The Chasam Sofer Haggadah will help us turn that ""Divine flow"" into a surging tide of faith and joy.

Although he fills his sack and his pockets with as much gold and precious gems as he can carry, he is dismayed that he has to leave so much behind. As he turns to go, he is upset to see that he hasn't even made a dent in the treasure. But he has no choice. He can't carry any more.With this parable, Rav Akiva Eiger, zt""l, the Chasam Sofer's renowned father-in-law, explains the pasuk ""I rejoice over Your word as one who finds great spoils"" (Tehillim 119:162). We can apply the same message to his sonin- law's teachings. Whatever Torah we might glean from them, it's but a drop in the ocean, a small dent in the immense treasure of knowledge that the Chasam Sofer possessed.The Chasam Sofer, rav and rosh yeshivah of Pressberg, was renowned for his brilliance. His knowledge encompassed every area of the Torah: both Halacha and aggadah, both the revealed and the hidden. He also taught thousands of talmidim, many of whom became great talmidei chachamim and leaders of Klal Yisrael in their own right.And he was an exemplary leader whose influence was widespread. As Rav Akiva Eiger told his daughter, ""The king may rule over this land, but your hUSBand rules over the entire world: people from every corner of the globe look to him for psak Halacha!"" The Chasam Sofer received and answered questions, not only from Poland, Russia, and Eretz Yisrael, but even countries in the East turned to him with their shailos.
The Chasam Sofer Pesach Haggadah was compiled from stories, meshalim, and divrei Torah from his many sefarim, from the sefarim of his talmidim, and from a selection of biographies. They provide a picture of a gadol who was both brilliant in his scholarship and a great leader of Klal Yisrael, fighting to preserve the fabric of the Torah way of life during the so-called Age of Enlightenment.Enhance your Seder table with teachings and stories about the Chasam Sofer and his talmidim. Though the treasure was endlessly vast, we can all benefit from the brilliant gems that he left behind.

With unrivaled clarity and grace, Rashi's commentary on the Torah has become an integral - and truly indispensable - part of Chumash study.There are more people studying Torah today than ever before, and their level of knowledge and sophistication is higher than ever. They know that beneath the deceptively straightforward exterior of Rashi's commentary lies a depth that has captivated the intellects of esteemed talmidei chachamim for more than eight centuries, and they wish to dig a bit deeper, to understand not just what Rashi says, but the underlying concepts. They want to gain a deeper look into Rashi's thought process and better understand those places where the commentators disagree with Rashi. What motivated Rashi with his specific remark? How does the wording in the Torah reveal Rashi's intent? To which passage in the Targum does Rashi allude?This new series will take you to a whole new level of understanding of the foremost commentary on Chumash. It will satisfy scholar, student and layman alike, and will become recognized as the standard comprehensive treatment of Rashi.The Elucidated Rashi on Chumash features:
An expanded translation and elucidation, written in a contemporary, readable style, and drawing upon the major commentaries on Rashi.
A short introduction to each Rashi, providing a preview of the topic.
Notes discussing ""What's bothering Rashi?""
Insights containing in-depth analysis of Rashi's words.

Through real - life examples, illuminating stories and insights from rabbinic sages, the author develops a practical blueprint for truly optimizing interpersonal relationships.The text concludes with an essay of profound significance. Entitled""Olam Katan"" (The human being is a microcosm of the universe), it discusses how the entire universe operates in response to man's deeds, which in turn, wield a great influence over everything that transpires in heaven and on earth.Written in a language and style that makes these lofty concepts engaging, accessible, and meaningful to all readers, the ELUCIDATED TOMER DEVORAh will alter and elevate the way you live and look at life.

Education With LoveChildren are life: As soon as a person has a child, he or she earns the title of parent, faced with the task of guiding the child along life's best path. As a parent, life takes on a brand new meaning. When a person has children, he in effect lives forever, since they are his continuance and legacy in the world.Children are livelihood: Perhaps a parent deserves a life of dire poverty. However, the little soul that a mother and father helped bring down into the world deserves to live in opulence. As such, the parents will enjoy an abundance of income by virtue of their child.Children are joy: Every new word that a baby says, every new action and every new development are reasons for parents to celebrate. Even as they grow, children grant their parents limitless joy.

Rabbi Shalom, after showing us the way to succeed in so many other areas of life such as marriage and finances, now shows us the way to success in child - rearing. His method, built around positive reinforcement and educating with love, demonstrates the proper way to establish clear boundaries without reprimanding or upsetting the child. First of all, as Rav Arush stresses throughout the book, parents must correct themselves before they correct their children. If the father is a Haman, he cannot expect to raise a Mordechai.This book is a great read, written in clear and comprehensible style. It's a must for every parent.

This is an enormous encouragement for those who pray and work on themselves, yet continue to fall from time to time. Rather than losing heart, they should regard their setback as part of their service to Hashem and their spiritual growth, and not as a failure."" From Chapter 4 of The Garden of Yearning With Hashem's loving grace, Yeshivat Chut Shel Chessed and Emuna Outreach are pleased to introduce ""The Garden of Yearning"" by Rav Shalom Arush translated into English. The book is now available here at the Beams. ""The Garden of Yearning"" is Rav Shalom's interpretation of Rebbe Nachman's ""Tale of the Lost Princess, "" which is loaded with Rebbe Nachman's powerful allusions that teach us the right road to emuna and to perfecting our souls. In effect, ""The Garden of Yearning"" is a sequel to ""The Garden of Emuna"", which is becoming an international hit having sold already more than 100,000 copies in Hebrew, English, and now Russian and French. Rav Shalom says that the most urgent item - in fact, the only item - on our agenda is spreading emuna as far, wide, and as fast as possible. With Hashem's blessing, that's exactly what we're trying to do. This is Rav Shalom Arush's amazing interpretation of Rebbe Nachman's ""Tale of the Lost Princess, "" revealing Rebbe Nachman's allusions to the proper service of Hashem. This book is a high-level sequel to The Garden of Emuna, for those who seriously seek more spirituality in their lives. Translated by Rav Lazer Brody.

Rabbi Michoel Ber WeissmandlA Giant In Torah And Hatzolas YisroelThe Gaon of Nitra is widely knownas ""Rebbe Michoel Ber"" or ""RabbiWeissmandl. He was world-renownedas a giant in Torah, in rescue, in chinuch,in ahavas Yisroel, and in yiras shomayim.He was fluent in Jewish history,as well as being an expert inmanuscripts of rishonim andacharonim. He was well-versed in remozim found inthe letters of the Torah, andin so much more.This unique combinationof the special traits of""The Gaon of Nitra"", ismost likely the reason thathe did not live in a vacuum.His life was totally devoted to theservice of Hashem, and he threwhis entire being into the mission athand.Due to his mesiras nefesh, ""The Gaonof Nitra"" was able to nimbly adapt to thevarious tasks that were thrust upon him and ablyassume a leadership role in solving them.Not least among them, the horrible years of the Holocaust, during whichEuropean Jewry was in grave danger of total destruction. Largely due tohis heroic mesiras nefesh, tens of thousands survived. They proceeded torebuild their lives, and create a living memorial to past Jewish life.He dedicated his remaining life to the difficult, rejuvenation of the oldJewish lifestyle in a new country, on the American continent. With rarestrength, he built the Nitra yeshiva in the United States. He proudlyshowed that, even in America, there is a possibility to remain on the ""oldgolden path"" trodden on by our holy Rabbis.

A comprehensive, Annotated Presentation of the Laws and Customs Pertaining to Pregnancy, Childbirth and Early ParenthoodThe observant jewish mother and father experience these feelings in an especially profound way. They are eager to fulfill the Biblical command to be fruitful and multiply, and concened to start the life of a child in an auspicious manner leading to a lifetime of Torah observance and mitzvos. Amid all the excitement they are surprised by the innumerable questions arising for the first time in their lives. Some of these relate directly to the birth of a child Can I drive to the hospital just before the end of Shabbos if the baby will be born after Shabbos? Is induction of labor sanctioned by Halacha? Can we name our son before his bris, if the bris will be delayed for a long time? The obstetrician suggests performing amniocentesis to check for birth defects, does Halacha sanction this? Other questions arise incidentally May a non-jew take me in the hospital elevator on Rosh Hashanah in order to hear shofar? Can I make kiddush even if I can only drink a small quantity of wine or grape juice? Can I daven while I have a catheter attached? The Halachos of Pregnancy and Childbirth is not just a book for the layman and woman, but also for the rabbi and the scholar. The erudition of its distinguished author is evident throughout the hundreds of detailed explanatory notes. Thein depth presentations of major halachic questions in the kovetz habiurim at the end of the book are halachic masterpieces, and have earned the enthusiastic approbations of great Poskim in the U.S. and in Eretz Yisroel. Seldom has a new work dealt so comprehensively with such a complex topic, His total command of these halachos and exceptionally clear and comprehensible presentation have earned him a large and enthusiastic following.

The Impact of As Long as I Live is a book about heroes about people who chose to truly live.After publishing As Long as I Live, Rabbi Aharon Margalit met dozens of people facing difficult challenges who related that his book had impacted their decision to stop wallowing in misery and instead draw on deep reserves of spiritual strength in order to choose life.This book contains fourteen incredible stories, each one depicting a challenge and how it was overcome, followed by ""Tools and Insights for Life,"" applying the lessons from the stories to our own lives.Here are some of the heroes you will meet:
Zevy, who made a personal commitment and saved his family from oblivion
Moishy, who soared to the heights in his wheelchair
Chaim, who, against all odds, recuperated from a stroke
Avigdor, the brave bachur who took responsibility for his mistake
Yehudah, who succeeded in utilizing the final moments of his life
These are only a few of the Jews whose lives have been impacted by As Long as I Live, who have changed their attitude to life's challenges, who, instead of being crushed by the weight of their troubles, looked for and found the reserves of strength hidden inside them and turned their difficulties and challenges into a means of personal empowerment.These stories are sure to touch you deeply and help you discover and tap into your own strengths and capabilities - and transform your life.

And in each car, a bachur's father or mother-or both-waited until a smiling bachur approached and received a nicely wrapped package.Meir's eyes were drawn to the open gate like a magnet. Another package from home. Another sumptuous cheesecake ...Suddenly he saw it. A silver Mitsubishi Lancer. Abba's car.He flew breathlessly down the stairs and raced toward the car-but then he saw that a different bachur had preceded him. A bachur he didn't even know by name. The bachur leaned through the open window and smiled at the driver, a man with a long black beard who looked nothing like Abba. A minute later, he sauntered inside holding a beautifully decorated cheese log.Meir turned on his heel and trudged back to his room, still trying to catch his breath. How had he been taken by such a foolish fantasy? For six months already, Abba's been in a place where he can’t drive or buy cheesecake. It's been six months since Meir had become an orphan.The beis midrash, he knew, was now packed with bachurim with glowing faces. They'd all received dairy delicacies in honor of Shavuos. They all had someone at home who'd thought of them-who had either baked or purchased a cheesecake especially for them, and then taken the trouble to deliver it to yeshivah. Someone cared about them. And him?He was an orphan.The fifteen protagonists in this book are fifteen incredible people who internalized that no matter the situation HaKadosh Baruch Hu places us in, we are obligated to bow our heads and accept it: This is the situation. The Borei Olam has placed me here. These are the waves of my personal sea.Then we can pick up our heads and look around for what it is we can do.Proactive thinking, taking personal responsibility, the awareness that one always has free will-help one make decisions with his mind rather than his emotions. They remind him that every lemon can be made into lemonade, all change can be a springboard for growth and renewal. Most of all, they help one remain levelheaded enough to do whatever he can within the parameters of his current circumstances.
In this book, you will find your story, the one that speaks to you, the one that touches you, the one that will help you make the right choices in life.The bestselling The Impact of As Long as I Live garnered passionate praise and enthusiastic responses from all over the world, indicating that it is not just another book. It is a life story that held a mirror into the life of every Jew, guiding and inspiring him to utilize his kochos and abilities.""This book is life-changing.

Recognition of God may have sat comfortably in the context of the ancient Near East out of which the Jewish people emerged. But several thousand years of exposure to rationally based Western cultures have transformed our personalities and outlook so that God often seems like a concept pasted incongruously onto our vision of reality. How can we achieve anemuna that is integrated, consistent with our rational context, yet still retains its Near Eastern soul?Award - winning author Rabbi Jeremy Kagan here presents us with keen and powerful insights into the nature ofemuna in the modern world. He shows how the experience of the Exodus from Egypt was structured to teach us to engage reality in a manner that sensitizes the various facets of our character to see creation reflected in the world around us - to become conscious of God through our perception of reality. Yet the perceptual component must be complemented with an inner sense of God that has a genuine basis, and that basis is to be sought in the depths of the self.

Israel's Battle for Its Inner Soul

A rich, wide-ranging portrait of the divisions among Israelis today, at a critical juncture in their country's history, by a veteran New York Times correspondent who has spent decades working in Israel
""A wondrous tale told through the agonizing and uplifting stories of Israel's many tribes - Jewish and Arab, religious and secular, new immigrants and veterans, soldiers and settlers.""-Martin Indyk, author of Master of the Game, and former U.S. ambassador to IsraelDespite Israel's determined staying power in a hostile environment, its military might, and the innovation it fosters in businesses globally, the country is more divided than ever. The old guard-socialist secular elites and idealists-are a dying breed, and the state's democratic foundations are being challenged. A dynamic and exuberant country of nine million, Israel is now largely comprised of native-born Hebrew speakers, and yet any permanent sense of security and normalcy is elusive.In The Land of Hope and Fear, we meet Israelis: Jews and Arabs, religious and secular, Eastern and Western, liberals and zealots-plagued by perennial conflict and existential threats, citizens who remain deeply polarized politically, socially, and ideologically, even as they undergo generational change and redefine what it is to be an Israeli. Who are these people and to what do they aspire?In moving narratives and with on-the-ground reporting, Isabel Kershner reveals the core of what holds Israel together and the forces that threaten its future through the lens of real people: a son of Zionist pioneers, cynical about what is to come and his people's status in it; a woman in her nineties whose life in a kibbutz has disintegrated; a brilliant poet caught up in the political maelstrom; an Arab gallery owner archiving a lost Palestinian landscape; and a descendant of the Russian aliyah; representing millions of culturally and religiously different Jews, laying bare the question Who is an Israeli? The Land of Hope and Fear decodes Israel today at its seventy-fifth anniversary, examining the ways in which the country has both exceeded and failed the ideals and expectations of its founders.

It is at this sorrowful time that we find ourselves clinging more than ever to the Torah, and specifically to the laws and customs of mourning. And it is at this time that we need answers to our questions on the halachos of mourning - sometimes very urgently.
 
 Rabbi Simcha Bunim Cohen has mastered the art of explaining Halacha in a way that can be immediately and clearly understood. For laymen, and especially for those who need a quick and definitive answer to their questions, this beautifully structured book takes the mourner from moments before the death of a loved one, through aninus, the funeral, the various stages of mourning, Kaddish, and up through the first yahrzeit. The concepts related to the Halacha are clearly defined, and the Halacha is presented concisely, so the reader immediately knows what to do. For those who want to study further, Hebrew footnotes show sources and discuss other opinions, and a detailed index makes it easy to find specific topics and questions.
 
 Does a person who'd been an onen have to make up the tefillos he missed, when the levayah is over? What is the special zimun said by mourners? May a person in the year of aveilus invite others for a Shabbos meal? Attend a grandson's Bar Mitzvah? Can a student send his teacher mishloach manos during the teacher's year of mourning? Case after case, question after question: Here are the answers, set out simply and with great clarity.
 
 We should not know of sorrow, but when mourning comes upon us we can turn to the Laws of Aveilus, and be comforted by our Torah.

A man of singularbrilliance, he was highly respected by the Torah leaders of his time.Yet he was also a charismatic teacher and a father figure to so many tough,undisciplined, alienated Jewish youths. A pioneer in kiruv rechokim longbefore kiruv was popular, he lovingly guided them to Torah and yirasShamayim, maintaining a close connection with them as they went on tobuild Torah-true lives.With extraordinary dedication and determination, this unassuming manovercame incredible obstacles to achieve what most people would haveconsidered to be unattainable goals. He revived Breslov Chassidus inAmerica, building it into a vibrant force where it had previously been allbut unknown.Rabbi Rosenfeld succeeded in visiting Uman numerous times, togetherwith groups of his talmidim. In that atheistic, totalitarian state, RabbiRosenfeld faced harsh interrogations and risked imprisonment.Undeterred, he never lost sight of his goals, pursuing them relentlessly -and successfully.

Holy Fire, Radiance And Warmth

LIKE THE SUN - a blazing ball of fire that one cannot gaze upon directly, yet whose radiance and warmth illuminates our world, infusing life, joy, and vigor into the soul of every living being - so was the life of Rabbeinu HaGaon HaRav Shimshon Dovid Pincus zt""l.Nurtured by parents who imbibed deeply from the Torah wellsprings of European Jewry - such as Rav Baruch Ber Leibowitz, Rav Eliezer Yehudah Finkel, and Sara Schenirer - young Shimshon grew to become a prominent Rav and world-renowned speaker, educating and influencing audiences across the Jewish spectrum. He manifested spiritual powers that seemed to transcend the forces of nature and human capacity. His heart burned with holy sparks of fervor, and those sparks grew into a mighty torch that illuminates our world with Torah, yiras Shamayim, and kedushah until this very day.Follow Rav Pincus's path from the American spiritual desert of the early twentieth century to Torah greatness. Based on the bestselling Hebrew biography Hashemesh Bigvuraso, it is a stirring collection of firsthand facts, hanhagos, and stories from distinguished rabbanim, talmidei chachamim, family members, and talmidim who ensured that this sefer - like its protagonist - bears the eternal stamp emes.

The Radiance and Inspiration of the Days of Triumph and GratitudeRevolutionize the way you look at Chanukah and Tu B'Shvat (and your life)!Chanukah - a time of joyous celebration - the radiance of menorahs glimmering in the darkness, the family gatherings, the traditional foods and songs... Yet there is so much more depth and meaning to the holiday, so many rich and inspiring lessons it has to elevate our lives. And though Tu B'Shvat is often almost overlooked, or simply marked by a few moments of eating dried fruit, it, too, is a day of profound spiritual awakening and significance.The unexplored depths of Chanukah and Tu B'Shvat beckon the thoughtful and perceptive Jew to discover the treasures that lie beneath the surface. In this collection of wide-ranging, stimulating, and original essays, Rabbi Daniel Glatstein draws upon a vast array of sources, many of them rare and some almost unknown, to show us the deep inner dimensions of these two holidays, and how they relate to contemporary times.What makes the mitzvah of Chanukah candles ""beloved to Hashem"" - and why is the mitzvah so hard to fulfill properly? Why did we need the miracle of the oil at all... and what does it tell us about our own daily lives? Why was the miracle of Chanukah not recorded in Tanach? What is the connection between Tu B'Shvat and repentance - and what is the difference between the teshuvah of Rosh Hashanah and that of Tu B'Shvat?Rav and founder of Machon Maggid Harakiah in Cedarhurst, New York, Rabbi Glatstein is one of the contemporary Jewish world's most popular speakers and respected maggidei shiur. As you read these brilliant and illuminating essays, you will understand why his more than 5,000 shiurim have garnered literally millions of views and downloads on Torahanytime.com and other venues, while his Hebrew-language sefarim, too, have been acclaimed throughout the Torah world.Like the glowing flames of the Menorah, The Light and the Splendor brings us a luminous new understanding of Chanukah and Tu B'Shvat, an important contribution to Torah literature and a precious gift to us all.

The Living Marriage is a translation and upgraded version of the Hebrew Book, Binyan HaBayis, which has helped tens of thousands of couples enhance their marriage over the past two decades. A couple's intimacy is of the central foundations of a vibrant relationship, and when approached properly it can bring the couple to the greatest levels of unity and happiness. The Living Marriage is a transmission of the Oral Torah which I personally received from our teachers, the Steipler, Rav Shniur Kotler, as well as other Gedolim, regarding this essential and often confused topic.

Whether or not there is any credence to that story, the fame and impact of the Maharal on his own generation and on all future generations surely rests on a more solid foundation. The Maharal of Prague was a towering giant in Torah and Kabbalah and a fearless leader of European Jewry during the sixteenth century. His seminal works have served as guideposts on the highways of Jewish thought for hundreds of years. In communal affairs, the Maharal guided the affairs of some of the most prominent Jewish communities in Central Europe, sometimes in an official rabbinic capacity, sometimes as a private citizen. His company and advice were sought by kings and noblemen, giving rise to many colorful legends, some of which appear in the pages of this book. ""The Maharal of Prague: The Story of Rabbi Yehudah Loew"" is a compelling portrait of this great spiritual figure whose immortal works dominate Jewish thought to this very day. Most of the material is derived from reliable sources, and the few unsubstantiated legends included are clearly defined as such for the benefit of the reader. Vivid images of the Jewish communities and life styles of sixteenth century Europe emerge from Yaakov Dovid Shulman's lively and descriptive prose, providing a fascinating setting for the life and works of the legendary Maharal of Prague.

He could never stop learning Torah -so he didn't sleep.In the ghetto he was concernedthat his food might be stolen -so he didn't eat.He was unable to keep to any schedule -so he learned and taught around the clock.He could never sit down in the yeshivah -because when he walked through the door,the whole Beis Midrash ran to him,demanding a shi'ur right away.So he stood on the steps and gave it.Even the Rogatchover Gaon praised his acuity -so he walked out immediately,not wanting to embarrass others who were present.Faced with the Sho'ah,""he didn't see Germans, he saw pesukim.""He was a super-genius that few could comprehend.But when called on to be the spiritual fatherof dozens of orphans after the War,he lowered himself to the level of each childand spoke the language that he could understand.He was ""not part of this world,""yet his heart overflowed with love.Sixty years after his departure,everyone who ever met him remembers him.Now it is time to tell his story in full.

Throughout the time of the first Beis Hamikdash. Bnei Yisrael had the FiveBooks of Torah, as well as the seforim of Yehoshua, Shoftim. Rus. Shmuel,Tehillim, Mishlei, and lyov. These seforim were enough to support Yisrael and guidethem to a life of shleimus.When Bnei Yisrael did not hold themselves to the highest of standards, Hashemsent nevi'im to rebuke them and bring them back.These words of nevuah were recorded as a guide to prevent Yisrael from driftingaway from Hashem to act like any other nation. In every generation, we are meantto benefit and grow from this rebuke and revelation. By studying the nevi'im. BneiYisrael can live up to their calling as the mamleches kohanim.Melachim Il concludes with the burning of the Beis Hamikdash and KlalYisrael's exile from their land. We are left longing for the redemption. Chazal statethat one who lights fire must pay for the damage it causes. Hashem lit the firea that destroyed the Beis Hamikdash, and we await and yearn for His promise torebuild it.


""Rabbi Ginian offers a compendium of commentaries written in a free-flowing styleto make the words of the Navi come alive with breadth and depth.""Rabbi Zev Leff
""A tremendous yashar koach for the gevaldic seforim you produced. I have really en-joyed them and learned a lot from them.""Rabbi Daniel Estreicher
""On one hand, his blend of meforshim written as a running commentary of the pe-sukim reads like a story. Yet, on closer examination, we gain great insights into theevents that occurred and what we as members of Klal Yisrael are to learn 'l'doros,' forgenerations to come.""Rabbi Paysach J. Krohn
""With your help, we will be able to better take advantage of the timeless messagesof the Nevi'im.""Rabbi Mordechai Kornfeld

The loss of a loved one is one of the most difficult and traumatic events we must face. Many of us struggle with the loss of connection to our loved ones, and we wonder if there is something we can do to keep that connection alive.


The truth is that we have the power to do something very meaningful. Our actions can do more than just maintain the connection. They can also give our departed loved ones a powerful aliyah (elevation) in Heaven. In fact, there are numerous opportunities for us to positively and productively channel our efforts for the benefit of our loved ones' neshamos (souls), and for our own benefit, as well.


This book is an inspirational and practical guide for anyone who desires to remember a loved one in a meaningful way. Painstakingly researched and masterfully written, it explains the fundamental ideas underlying the concept of providing merit for a soul and then offers hands-on, practical guidance for all the many aliyah opportunities that our tradition describes.


It answers questions like...

-Why should I do things in memory of my loved ones?-How can the things I do here help a neshamah in the next world? 
-What is the single most powerful tool to provide merit for the neshamah? 
-Is there any difference between a child doing something in memory of parents, and other relatives or friends doing things in their memory? 

Whether you have suffered a recent loss or many years have passed, this book will open your eyes with its profound insights into the concepts and practices of aliyas neshamah. It is ideal for any caring individual who wonders: ""What can I do? ""


Also features:

-Section summaries for easy reference
-Practical guidance sections listing resources and creative ideas
-Mishnayos for each letter of the aleph-beis, with English translation and elucidation
-An aliyas neshamah journal to keep track of your commitments and accomplishments

Insights from the Novominsker RebbeRabbi Yaakov Perlow
How to describe Rav Yaakov Perlow, the Novominsker Rebbe? He was a Rebbe and Rosh Yeshivah. A leader of the worldwide Torah community. A brilliant thinker, gifted speaker and writer, a compassionate guide and advisor to thousands, and, of course, an outstanding talmid chacham.We all know the story of the Exodus, of Yetziyas Mitzrayim. In The Novominsk Haggadah Rav Perlow reveals to us the neshamah, the soul of that story. He examines each word of the Haggadah and creates a brilliant synthesis of machshavah and hashkafah, of Midrashim and commentaries. He shares with us a breathtaking view of the mission and miracle of the Jewish People, and gives us a new and powerful appreciation of what we are celebrating as we sit down to our Seder.Here are so many important themes, so many eye-opening insights. What does it mean to be the Chosen People? What are the foundations of our emunah? How can we understand Hashem's unalterable love for Klal Yisrael? What are the lessons of history that we can learn, and how do they pertain to our lives today? What does our past tell us about our future?
The Novominsk Haggadah also includes a special section on the Rebbe's teachings of Shir HaShirim, which gives us a new and intriguing understanding of its words.
Rabbi Yecheskel Ostreicher was a close talmid of Rav Perlow. Working together with members of the Novominsker's family and many of his students, he has drawn upon the Rebbe's shiurim, speeches and writings to fashion a Haggadah that will enrich our Seder, and our lives.

The Prayer of ProtectionThe prayer that Jews turn to in times of challenge:The power and majesty ofYOSHEIV BESEISER


This beloved chapter of Tehillim is about emunah and bitachon.
It's about Hashem's protection in times of trouble.
It's about knowing - not just believing, but really knowing - that ourfate is entirely in Hashem's compassionate and loving Hands.
It's about our lives.The Midrash tells us that Tehillim 91, Yosheiv BeSeiser, was composed by Moshe Rabbeinu as a prayer of protection. It is a lyrical and moving declaration of Hashem's care and compassion for us and our deep trust in Him. It has traditionally been recited by Jews during times of danger and distress.Bestselling author Rabbi Yechiel Spero gives us a new understanding of Yosheiv BeSeiser through his fascinating commentary and dozens of inspiring and unusual stories. In a car whose gas tank is on fire, in a tunnel dug by terrorists with murder in their hearts and weapons in their hands, even in an American army unit in the First World War that recited Psalm 91 every single day - and did not suffer even one combat-related death - in historic events and everyday happenings, we see the fulfillment of the immortal words of Yosheiv BeSeiser.This beautiful work opens our eyes and we see Hashem's protective Arms around us, a Father shielding His children - and we are no longer afraid.

There's a villain out to hang Mordechai and murder his countrymen; a king who enjoys drinking; and a beautiful and noble queen. There are assassins, palace intrigue and a climactic battle scene - and a happy ending, to boot. What more could you ask for in a good child's story? The holiday associated with the book can seem child-like, too. Purim is celebrated with costumes, carnivals, and abundant merriment. Kids dress up as Esther, Mordechai, Haman and Achashveirosh, wearing plastic hats and cellophane scepters. Purim is the great holiday of make-believe. All this make believe, though, can have unintended consequences. Chief among them is the fact that many of us are likely to remain with childlike views of Purim and the Megillah long after we've turned adults. Our perspective upon Mordechai and Esther and their struggle can easily remain as one-dimensional as the face paint we use to impersonate these people in costume. In this book, Rabbi Fohrman invites the reader to look at the Book of Esther with fresh eyes; to join him, as it were, on a guided adventure - a close reading of the ancient biblical text. In so doing, he reveals another Purim story; a richer, deeper narrative more suited perhaps, to the eyes of an adult than to a child. As layers of meaning are gradually revealed, Esther's hidden story comes alive in a vibrant, unexpected way - offering the reader a fascinating and stirring encounter with the queen whose costume they wore as children - the queen they thought they knew.

The Rav Schwab Haggadah provides us with an in-depth view of the Haggadah Shel Pesach through the lens of one of the Gedolei HaRabbanim of our time. Rav Shimon Schwab was renowned for imparting generations of Jews with the foundational principles of emunah, bitachon, yiras Shamayim, emes and ehrlichkeit, as well as for his brilliant and novel Torah thoughts. His teachings reflect a sincerity and love of Hashem and His Torah that is infectious.The Rav Schwab Haggadah offers a wealth of insights into the basics of emunah, conveyed with great passion and emotion. Rav Schwab's style is clear, fresh, thought-provoking, and always inspiring. This volume is a compendium of commentaries and insights gleaned from the Rav's teachings in Maayan Beis Hashoeva, Rav Schwab on Prayer, and from shiurim, writings, and speeches, as well as from many never-before published kesavim (notes).Rav Schwab was a Rav for over 65 years in Germany, Baltimore, and New York, as well as a Rosh Beis Din, posek and mechanech par excellence. A product of Yeshiva Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch in Frankfurt, Germany, he also gained exposure to the great yeshivos of Eastern-Europe and their style of limud haTorah and mussar. He was a talmid of such pre-war legendary greats as Reb Leizer Yudel Finkel, Rav Yeruchem Levovitz, Rav Chaim Telzer and Rav Yosef Leib Bloch. The result was a magnificent synthesis of both glorious traditions.
The Rav Schwab Haggadah will enrich our Seder, our Pesach, and our lives.Includes a New, Expansive Commentary on Hallel

Invite Reb Moshe Feinstein zt""l to your Seder table.
The Reb Moshe Haggadah beautifully captures the many facets of the gaon and posek hador: his brilliance in piskei Halacha and Gemara; his insights and deep understanding of Torah hashkafah; his incredible diligence and his extraordinary compassion.
Much of the commentary is taken from Reb Moshe's prolific writings on Halacha, Chumash, and Talmud. Stories about Reb Moshe from dozens of other sources paint an inspiring and breathtaking portrait of a caring and empathetic leader who had a profound understanding and endless love for the Jews he led for so many decades.
When we read about the""Four Sons"" we will hear Reb Moshe share his teachings on chinuch, child - rearing and Torah education. From a Shabbos HaGadol lecture given by Reb Moshe in 1922, we listen to him compare the merciless Communist regime where he lived to Pharaoh's Egypt. From the Ten Plagues Reb Moshe offers us a new understanding of the power of free choice; from the Splitting of the Sea he points out a vital lesson in strengthening our faith.
We are taught that the voices of the great Torah scholars are not stilled even after their passing, and in these pages we can clearly hear the voice of the beloved Torah leader, HaGaon Reb Moshe Feinstein zt""l.

The inspiring life and impact ofRabbi Levi Yitzchok Horowitzthe Bostoner Rebbe of Boston and Har Nof
""Do you know where I can find a place to stay for Shabbos?""""Sure. Go to the Grand Rabbi on Beacon Street. He always has room for one more.""He came from a long line of chassidic leaders, reaching all the way back to the Baal Shem Tov. He was the son of the first Bostoner Rebbe, Rabbi Pinchos Dovid Horowitz. He was a brilliant Torah scholar, having learned at Mesivta Torah Vodaath under one of the greatest roshei yeshivah of that time. And yet in his profound modesty, Rav Levi Yitzchok Horowitz did not see himself as a rebbe.Hashem, though, decreed otherwise. When a small group of his father's followers pleaded with Rav Levi Yitzchok to come to Boston and lead their shul, he acquiesced. And in the next sixty years, he and his devoted rebbetzin would change the lives of thousands. As rav of his kehillah - which included influential professionals and intellectuals - a dynamic leader of the Boston Jewish community, and Shabbos host to scores of searching college students, the Bostoner Rebbe was a pivotal figure in the flourishing of Torah life in America in the decades after World War II.In The Rebbe on Beacon Street you will read of the Rebbe's wisdom and warmth, of his burning desire to help every Jew who came his way, both physically and spiritually. Like Avraham Avinu and Sarah Imeinu, the Rebbe and Rebbetzin on Beacon Street opened their homes to all: everyone was welcomed and treated like family.Among the Rebbe's greatest achievements was his founding of ROFEH International, an organization dedicated to providing medical referrals and support services to sick people and their families.When already in his mid-60s - when many are beginning to contemplate retirement - the Rebbe founded a new community with the opening of a shul in Jerusalem's Har Nof neighborhood. For the next two decades, he would spend six months a year leading and developing a Bostoner kehillah in Eretz Yisrael, while continuing to be a father figure to his flock in Boston.Come and meet The Rebbe on Beacon Street. As you bask in the glow of his overflowing ahavas Yisrael, you will feel inspired. Enlightened. Transformed.

Including theשלש סעודותDrashosRav Avigdor Miller'slegendary Thursday nightlectures were recorded andhave become deservedly famous.But what became of the drashos that could not be recorded?What became of the words of inspiration the Rav delivered beforetekias shofar on Rosh Hashanah... before Ne'ilah on Yom Kippur... orafter Hallel on Sukkos? What about the thoughts shared at the shul'sWine and Nut Party on Acharon shel Pesach... and the commentsdelivered after leining Megillas Rus on Shavuos? What about theweekly drashos on Shabbos morning and at Shalosh Seudos?In the 1970's I began transcribing these lectures from memoryimmediately after Shabbos and Yom Tov, and starting in the 1980's,I distributed these transcripts in the shul-with the Rav's permission -averaging one pamphlet a year for thirty years.In 2019, in conjunction with Simchas Hachaim PublishingThe Yom Tov Drashos ('ספר שיח הכהן חלק א) was published.Now we present The Shabbos Drashos Volume One ('ספר שיח הכהן חלק ב)on Bereishis and Shemos. This volume includes both the drashosdelivered before Mussaf and those delivered during Shalosh Seudos.These drashos are presented exactly as they were spoken - inthe Rav's inimitable style, with his anecdotes and personalreferences included. So on Shabbos, this sefer will whisk you to theBais Yisroel shul on Ocean Parkway, and you too will be zocheh tohear the Rav's Shabbos drashos.

In Thirty Years, the Kedushah, the Holiness of Shabbos, Has Not Changed...But Your Kitchen Has.The Shabbos Kitchen -- Fully Revised and Expanded



Thirty years ago, Rabbi Simcha Bunim Cohen published his halachic masterwork, The Shabbos Kitchen. With its clear, understandable explanations of the issues involved and extensive notes, tens of thousands turned to The Shabbos Kitchen to understand the often complex halachos of preparing food and other kitchen activities on Shabbos.With the passing of time and massive changes in technology, many new questions have been raised, many new piskei halachah have been developed. Raw fish, once considered inedible, now graces our sushi - has its status of muktzeh changed, as well? What issues are raised by modern-day water coolers, warming drawers, and digital features on refrigerators?The Shabbos Kitchen -- Fully Revised and Expanded includes ten completely new chapters discussing halachos and scenarios not included in the earlier volume. In addition, as a world-class posek, Rabbi Cohen has heard countless shailos about Shabbos observance in these decades, and he has incorporated many of them into existing chapters. Indeed, one chapter with common applications is twice the size of the original, and two others, also pertaining to melachos that apply frequently, are three times the size!While many things have changed in these past decades, some things stay the same. Things like our devotion to Shabbos, and our desire to show our love for it by keeping its halachos properly. This sefer will enable us to do just that.

A Memoir of Jewish LifeIn Ukraine and CrimeaSet in Ukraine and Crimea, this unique autobiography offers a fascinat-ing, detailed picture of life in late nineteenth - and early twentieth-centuryTsarist Russia. Goldenshteyn (1848-1930), a traditional Jew who was or-phaned as a young boy, is a master storyteller. Folksy, funny, streetwise, andself-confident, he is a keen observer of nineteenth-century Eastern Europe.His accounts are vivid and readable, sometimes stunning in their intensity.The memoir is brimming with information; his adventures shed light oncommunal life, persecution, family relationships, religious practices andbeliefs, social classes, local politics, interactions between Jews and otherreligious communities (including Muslims, who formed the majority ofCrimea's populace), epidemics, poverty, competition for resources, migra-tion, war, modernity and secularization, holy men and charlatans, acts ofkindness and acts of treachery. In chronicling his own life, Goldenshteyninadvertently tells a bigger story - the story of how a small, oppressedpeople, among other minority groups, struggled for survival in the massiveRussian Empire.Until now, only a small circle of Yiddish-speaking scholars had accessto this extremely significant primary source. This translation is a game-changer, making this treasure trove of information accessible to academicsand ordinary readers alike. Informed by research in Ukrainian, Israeli, andAmerican archives and personal interviews with the few surviving indi-viduals who knew Goldenshteyn personally, The Shochet is a magnificentnew contribution to Jewish and Eastern European history.

What are you willing to wait for?I'm not going to sit and wait for a bagel for two hours. It's not worth it. Why? Because life is more important.How long will you sit and wait for a friend? You'll sit as long as they are important to you. Some friends are""two - hours"" important to you, others are""three - hours."" Another is even""five - hours"" important. But I'm not going to sit for three days.Can you imagine waiting for somebody 2,000 years?We've been waiting for Yerushalayim for 2,000 years.We've been thinking about Yerushalayim for 2,000 years.The truth is that I'm always thinking about Yerushalayim. It is the one place I never stop thinking about.br? You can talk to me about anything in the world, but deep, deep inside, I'm thinking about Yerushalayim.You can talk to me about anything in the world, but deep, deep inside, I don't stop thinking about the 6 million. I can't.How can you forget them for one second?How can you forget Yerushalayim for one second?There is a little land. In that little land, there is a little city. In that city there is a little street, and on that street there is a little wall. When you stand by that Holy Wall, you can hear the footsteps of our father Abraham, and you can hear the trumpet of the Great Day to come. You hear the past and you can hear the future. You can hear the singing of the Levites. Or, you can hear us crying, going into exile. You can hear the six million crying out of the gas chambers, and you can hear the trumpet of the Great Day to come. I was standing one early morning by the Holy Wall, and I was saying Kaddish for my father. But when you stand by that Holy Wall, you say Kaddish for the whole world. Sometimes you feel like saying Kaddish for your own soul, and sometimes you feel like saying Kaddish for tomorrow. Then you hear the words Yisgadal V'yiskadash Shmei Raba, May G-d s Name become great and sanctified, and you remember there is one G-d, and you know that the Great Morning is coming. You know that day and night will get together. The living and the dead, we and the whole world. This is my song, the song of tears, because on that Great Day the tears will march through the world, and the whole world will join them. The tears will clear the world and prepare the world. Everything will come together. We will all come together. It will be a new morning - a new beginning. In this remarkable and life - changing work, the reader is transported to the Holy Temple in Jerusalem to be inspired by the teachings of Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach zt""l.

The Prayer of Comfort and Consolationwith Stories and InsightsSaying Kaddish for a loved one. It is one of the most well-observed Jewish traditions. However, its cryptic languageoften makes this sacred and hallowed prayer feel unrelatable.This powerful and inspiring book changes that. Rabbi YechielSpero uses classic Torah sources, insights, and of course! -stories to explore the essence and, indeed, the soul of Kaddish.Within The Soul of Kaddish we will find chizuk, hope, andencouragement. We will better understand the unparalleledpower of Kaddish and of doing good deeds to benefit aperson's neshamah. Indeed, we will also gain insight into howwe can learn to accept loss and bereavement, and how to findtrue comfort and consolation. The Soul of Kaddish also includesa section on Mashiach and techiyas hameisim.It is never easy to lose a family member. But this book cantransform a time of challenge into an opportunity for growth.And it will show us how to take that growth - and to take ourmitzvos, good deeds, and, of course, the recital of Kaddish - tocreate eternal merit for those whom we loved.

Personalities, Places, and MomentsIn the Courtyards of Yerushalayim and its NeighborhoodsYerushalayim of the Yishuv Hayashan is a city ofalleys, walls, and shadows, but more than any-thing, it is a city of people: a city of Jews whoserve their Creator with simplicity and sincerity,who wear the same authentic ""zebra stripes"" and wide-brimmed hats worn for hundreds of years.The primary aspect of Yerushalayim is its soul. The an-cient, pure, beautiful spirit that hasn't been blemished bythe passing years, hasn't submitted to modernization, andhasn't been influenced by the passage of time. Those withsharp vision and understanding can see the complete,strong, inner-focused Yerushalmi character that hides un-derneath the white, pom-pom-topped yarmulke.Yerushalayim of the Yishuv Hayashan is a city of clothes-lines stretched above wooden beams; of righteous womenpaddling old, worn mattresses on Erev Pesach; of Jews go-ing out at midnight to serve their Creator. It is a city of bigshtreimels elegant, though worn - that are taken out ev-ery Erev Shabbos, when Jews with wet peyos stride in thegold-striped tunics that are covered by the thin brown coatknown as the djubeh.It is a city of Torah personalities, talmidei chachamim andgeonim, who blend into the curves in the paths, walkinghumbly and silently on the side of the road, demanding noattention. This is a city of beautiful simplicity, of impressivepoverty, of concealed genius, of righteousness and exaltedasceticism hidden within modest behavior, and of the sim-ple chesed that is done constantly in its courtyards and al-leys without anybody taking notice.Yerushalayim of pure gold is concealed under the roughsurface of people who sometimes seem cold and aloof, butwho burn with the fire of humanity and Yiddishkeit that canbe awakened by a pashkevil hanging on the ancient walls ofthe Yishuv Hayashan.
Aryeh Ehrlich, a prominent chareidi journalist who was born in Batei Ungarin,often tells the story of Yerushalayim to the outside world. Baruch Yaari is an accom-plished photographer who was allowed entry with his camera, for over fifteen years,into the most guarded places of the Yishuv Hayashan. Together, these two artistshave created this pictorial album that documents the alleys and shuls, the storesand workshop Erev Shabbos and yearly events, and the happy and sad moments inthe neighborhoods that are more a legendary concept than a mere residential area.The Soul of Yerushalayim documents the heart of Yerushalayim that continues toexist in the present with that same old spirit and authenticity. It takes the reader onan enchanting journey through the wondrous stones, alleys, yards, moments, andpeople of Yerushalayim shel Maalah.

From Theodor Herzl ToThe Dream For Peace
More than 70 years after Israel declared independence on14 May 1948, the dramatic events before and since thispoint form an extraordinary period of history.From its beginnings as a dream of Theodor Herzl 120 years ago, Israel was established so that Jews anywhere in the world, out of need or choice, could have a homeland of their own. Five wars tested Israel's ability to survive. Despite conflict and terror, Israel has sought peace through both secret and public negotiations, an effort which continues to this day. Through all of this, Israel remains a vibrant Jewish State and homeland. The Story of Israel brings the period to life through rare documents, photographs, maps and Martin Gilbert's illuminating text.
Sir Martin Gilbert (1936-2015), biographer of Winston Churchill and a leading historian on the twentieth century, wrote 25 books on aspects of Jewish history, including 10 books on Israel. He received honorary degrees from three Israeli universities and the prestigious Dan David Prize in 2012. In 1995 he was awarded a knighthood for services to British history and international relations. For more information, visit www.martingilbert.com.

Elie Wieseľ's heartbreaking narrative poem about history,immortality, and the power of song, accompanied by magnificentfull-color illustrations by award-winning artist Mark Podwal.Based on an actual event that occurred during World War II.

IT IS THE EVENING BEFORE THE HOLIDAY OF PURIM, and the Nazis have given the ghetto's leaders twenty-four hours to turn over ten Jews to be hanged to ""avenge"" the deaths of the ten sons of Haman, the villaiìn of the Purim story, which celebrates the triumph of the Jews of Persia over potential genocide some 2,400 years ago. If the leaders refuse, the entire ghetto will be liquidated. Terrified, they go to the ghetto's rabbi for advice; he tells them to return the next morning. Over the course of the night the rabbi calls up the spirits of legendary rabbis from centuries past for advice on what to do, but no one can give him a satisfactory answer. The eighteenth-century mystic and founder of Hasidism, the Baal Shem Tov, tries to intercede with God by singing a niggun-a wordless, joyful melody with the power to break the chains of evil.The next evening, when no volunteers step forward, the ghetto's residents are informed that in an hour they will all be killed. As the minutes tick by, the ghetto's rabbi teaches his assembled community the song that the Baal Shem Tov had sung the night before. And then the voices of these men, women, and children soar to the heavens.How can the heavens not hear?

Tidbits on Jewish Life for theupcoming year and beyond
We are pleased to present this publication, the Tidbits Collection to our readers. This book is dedicated l'ilui nishmas my dear mother, Mrs. Rachel Zlotowitz a""h who passed away as the finishing touches were being placed into this work. The weekly Tidbits has, b""h, been met with much acclaim. It all started a few years back following the passing of my father, Rav Meir Zlotowitz z""l on Rosh Chodesh Tammuz 5777 (2017). Throughout my life, my father was a source for inspiration and guidance. When a question presented itself leaving me in doubt, whether regarding Yom Tov or on any other occasion, about our minhag or a halachah, I would turn to him for guidance. With his passing I felt a personal void, a void that led me to recognize that a publication with the relevant information for Jewish life can play a vital role. The Tidbits slowly evolved into the success it is today, providing Klal Yisrael with information they need regarding minhagim and halachos throughout the year. Many Tidbits are based on what I saw by my father z""l who followed his family minhag along with guidance from his great Rabbeim, Harav Moshe Feinstein zt""l and Harav David Feinstein zt""l. Each person should certainly follow their own traditions and the guidance they receive from their Rabbanim, while using this guidebook as a point of reference.Over the course of life, one has the opportunity to attend simchos and bez""h to make simchos as well. The Tidbits on the Lifecycle series, included in this work, was created with the baal simchah and their guests in mind, so that they can know and understand the events they are celebrating.A source for guidance, reminders and Torah knowledge, the Tidbits has the zechus of providing for a broad audience spanning the entire spectrum of Klal Yisrael. The Tidbits is distributed in print to close to 500 Shuls and tens of thousands of homes. Thousands of subscribers receive the digital distribution, via email and WhatsApp. demonstrating the thirst that Jews have to be connected to Torah and yiddishkeit. We thank ArtScroll/Mesorah Publications for their assistance in distributing the weekly edition.This publication can be used for any year and contains all the information and Torah which is enjoyed each week. The reminder section herein contains information specific to the period of Kislev 5783 thru Adar 5784. The rest of the book is not year-specific.As you go through this book we kindly request that you share with us any insight, corrections or feedback you may have. We hope you find this publication insightful and helpful.Ira Zlotowitz

Written by Rabbi Yaakov Culi, one of the greatest Sephardic sages of his times, the book was first published in 1730. It changed the spiritual climate of the entire Mediterranean region. Eastern Jews esteemed Me'am Lo'ez as a major classic, affording it the same status as the Talmud and Mishnah. Reading it each day was a religious duty; it was a highly popular text for synagogue classes held each evening. Many count Me'am Lo'ez among the best commentaries ever written on the Torah - in any language. The book is a veritable encyclopedia of Jewish knowledge.

People benefit from his counsel...and it bestows on him royalty,dominion, and acuteness in judgment.The secrets of the Torah are revealed to him,and he becomes an ever-flowing spring,like a stream that never ceases...""- Avos 6:1 -All this, and more, could be attributed to the Sar HaTorah,Rav Chaim Kanievsky, zt""l, who had learned and completedall of Torah, Written and Oral, each and every year from thetime he was a young man. Not only was his knowledge ofthe revealed aspects of Torah evident, but so was hisexpertise in the mystical aspects, and hundreds of peoplestreamed to his house each day seeking the counsel of thePrince of Torah.Aside from Rav Chaim's teachings and advice, countlessstories and firsthand witness accounts demonstrate thetruth of the principle ""a tzaddik decrees and the decree isfulfilled."" His passing left an immense void, as evidencedby the hundreds of thousands who accompanied him to hisfinal resting place.In the Toras Chaim Haggadah, compiled by Rabbi ShalomMeir Wallach, one will find commentary on the Haggadahstraight from Rav Chaim's own writings, advice on manyand varied topics from shidduchim to chinuch to tefillah,and, of course, stories that inspire and impart memorablelessons for life.

We turn to Tehillim in times of joy and times of trouble; for comfort and guidance; to beg Hashem for help and thank Him for His blessings. King David's words have the uncanny power of touching all people, at all times, in all situations.Now in a convenient size - this book will change the way you understand and say Tehillim.In The Touch of Tehillim Rabbi Yechiel Spero brings a new dimension to Tehillim's eternal words. He introduces every chapter with insights culled from dozens of commentaries, both classic and contemporary, and then, with the flair for storytelling that has made him a bestselling author, he illustrates Tehillim's messages with true - life stories.When David HaMelech speaks of living a life built on truth, we are inspired - and when we read a story of a CEO who finds a novel way to test the honesty of his executives, we see how the concept plays itself out in 21st century life. Here are stories of heroism, emunah, and profound optimism - in a tiny school in Yemen, in Hebron Yeshiva after the dreadful massacre, in 21st century hospitals and forgotten Ukranian villages.
 Tehillim is, indeed, the song of the Jewish People - and in this book Rabbi Spero is like a maestro conducting its splendid symphony, helping us hear its beauty and harmony, allowing us to savor and appreciate every word of King David's timeless song.Includes the Complete Hebrew Text of Tehillim.

The Nazi net closed slowly around the Jews of Poland, impoverishing them, demoralizing them, enslaving them, isolating them in ghettos and finally herding them into concentration camps. Million of Polish Jews were caught in the monstrous Nazi trap, while thousands more fled into hiding in the cities and the countryside. For the desperate fugitives life was always a continuous nightmare, with agonizing days and terror-filled nights, never knowing if the next day would bring starvation or discovery. ""They Called Me Frau Anna"" is the breathtaking account of one valiant Jewish woman and her struggle to save her two small children in the midst of the blazing inferno that was consuming her family and her people. With false identification papers, she wanders from town to town seeking shelter and food for herself and children, always in fear of discovery and betrayal. In episode after hair-rising episode, guided by an unmistakable hashgachah pratis, she manages to elude capture, only to find herself back on the street in search of a new hiding place. Finally, she finds refuge in Krakow as a housekeeper for Dr. Helmut Sopp, a high-ranking Nazi official who is eventually imprisoned as a war criminal. After earning the respect of Sopp ands his wife Toni, she is allowed to bring her children to stay with her, but her harrowing experiences continues, taking a new dimension as she must constantly deflect the suspicions of the numerous Nazis she comes into contact with in the course of her duties. Through all her tragedy and heartbreak, she finds in herself deep reservoirs of faith and fortitude that help her keep alive a tiny spark of hope and sanity in her darkest hours. ""They Called Me Frau Anna"" is the second volume in ""The Holocaust Diaries, "" of which the highly acclaimed ""Late Shadows"" was the inaugural volume. In keeping with the theme of the collection, it is the personal statement of the survivor in whom the holocaust brought out profound spiritual qualities, who emerged from this terrible crucible victorious rather than crushed and defeated. All in all, it is a book permeated by the noble spirit of the author and the indomitable faith that helped her rise above the horrors of her experiences and emerge stronger and more inspired than ever before

Here were sefarim that you could read at the Shabbos table. And not just because they were books on the parashah.
 Once, a bachur who had learned with the Mir Yeshivah in Shanghai got engaged. The rosh yeshivah, Rav Dovid Povarsky, zt""l, and the mashgiach, Rav Yechezkel Levenstein, zt"" ""l, both attended the vort, the engagement celebration. The rosh yeshivah asked the mashgiach to speak, but he declined. He turned to Rav Galinsky to do the honors.
 Rav Galinsky stood up and said, ""I'll explain why the mashgiach isn't speaking. Bnei Yisrael complained about the mann in the desert (Bamidbar21:5). But what did they have to complain about? The mann could taste like any food in the world! But the mann was also'k'zera gad - like a coriander seed' (Shemos 16:31). The word gad can mean to'relate' something. The mann'related' the sins of Klal Yisrael. If someone among them sinned, the next day he would be forced to wander around to find his portion of mann (Yoma75a).
""So the Jewish people pleaded:""We'll hear a mussar shmuess if we must, but please, not during the meal!""
 This is the secret to Rav Yaakov Galinsky's derashos and lessons, and the secret to V'Higadeta's popularity. V'Higadeta on the weekly parashah certainly contains mussar lessons to learn from, but it isn't a heavy tome that a person has to struggle to wade through. The lessons are imparted with captivating stories and insightful ideas that will make you nod and laugh.
 Rav Galinsky delivered thousands of derashosin the halls of yeshivos and batei midrash, and before huge audiences, both religious and nonreligious. He is responsible for bringing so many people closer to Hashem.
 Now, finally, his derashos are accessible in print to the English - speaking audience.
 
 In his unique, penetrating style - with stories and parables, lessons and maxims, pesukim and ma'amarei Chazal - he brings the weekly parashah alive. As you unearth this magnificent treasure of stories and real - life lessons, Rav Galinsky's derashos will transform you and your Shabbos table.

In Parashas Vayikra, the Torah teaches that if a man who was tamei, impure, walked into the Beis HaMikdash, he was required to bring a korban to atone. The Gemara emphasizes that he needed atonement whether he walked into the Mikdash and didn't realize that he was impure, or whether he knew he was impure but didn't realize that he had walked into the Mikdash. 


Rav Yaakov Galinsky, zt""l, asked a question about this: The Gemara is talking about the Beis HaMikdash in all its glory-the kohanim serving, the Levites singing. Could it possibly be that a person entered the Mikdash and didn't realize it? 

It's hard to believe, but yes. Think about it: How many times does a person forget whether he said Birkas HaMazon after he ate, or whether or not he recited Ya'aleh V'Yavo in Shemoneh Esrei? When a person lacks awareness, he makes mistakes and loses his focus. He could even forget that he's standing in the very Courtyard of the Beis HaMikdash! 

In delivering his derashos, Rav Galinsky's aim was to inspire, to awaken, to make people aware. To give meaning and focus to the tefillos we pray, the Torah we learn, the mitzvos we do. And he did it with a smile and a well-placed joke, a captivating story, and a riveting devar Torah. 

Rav Galinsky delivered thousands of derashos in the halls of yeshivos and batei midrash, and before huge audiences, both religious and nonreligious. He is responsible for bringing so many people closer to Hashem. 

Now his derashos are finally accessible in print to the English-speaking audience. 

In his unique, penetrating style-with stories and parables, lessons and maxims, pesukim and ma'amarei Chazal-he brings the weekly parashah alive. As you unearth this magnificent treasure of stories and real-life lessons, Rav Galinsky's derashos will transform you and your Shabbos table.

Alcoholics Anonymous has made famous its twelve steps to sobriety. In Waking Up Just in Time, Dr. Abraham J. Twerski shows how you can use the twelve steps to cope with any of life's difficulties, from dishonesty and intolerance of others to substance abuse. Dr. Twerski leads the way through AA's twelve steps toward a happier, more fulfilling life.A few years ago, Dr. Twerski found that the Peanuts comics of Charles M. Shulz were helpful in his work with psychiatric patients. The humorous words and pictures in Peanuts gave patient and doctor a common ground for talking. Now Dr. Twerski again calls on Charlie Brown, Snoopy, and friends to help illustrate his points in their own inimitable way.

And now, it's better than ever. Every parent's must-have/go-to is completely updated. Keeping the trademark month-by-month format that allows parents to take the potentially overwhelming first year one step at a time, First Year is easier-to-read, faster-to-flip-through, and new-family-friendlier than ever-packed with even more practical tips, realistic advice, and relatable, accessible information than before. Illustrations are new, too. Among the changes: Baby care fundamentals-crib and sleep safety, feeding, vitamin supplements-are revised to reflect the most recent guidelines. Breastfeeding gets more coverage, too, from getting started to keeping it going. Hot-button topics and trends are tackled: attachment parenting, sleep training, early potty learning (elimination communication), baby-led weaning, and green parenting (from cloth diapers to non-toxic furniture). An all-new chapter on buying for baby helps parents navigate through today's dizzying gamut of baby products, nursery items, and gear. Also new: tips on preparing homemade baby food, the latest recommendations on starting solids, research on the impact of screen time (TVs, tablets, apps, computers), and ""For Parents"" boxes that focus on mom's and dad's needs. Throughout, topics are organized more intuitively than ever, for the best user experience possible.

Everybody reads the comics. A chuckle, and then on to the serious stuff. One cartoonist, Charles M. Schulz, has for years done more than just make us laugh. He has offered a treasury of thought, philosophy and psychology.Dr. Abraham Twerski, during his career as a clinical psychiatrist, has turned his patients toward Peanuts comic strips. Time after time he has found that the wit and wisdom in Schulz's strips is just what his patients needed to see themselves in a new light. It is a unique and effective jumping-off point for the practical, down-to-earth counseling that Dr. Twerski provides.Let Dr. Twerski help supply the answers to a better life for you, and if you get a few laughs along the way, so much the better.

Rabbi Mattisyahu Salomon's influence radiates far beyond his""headquarters"" as Mashgiach of Lakewood's Beth Medrash Govoha. Thinker, speaker, guide, and inspirational leader, Rabbi Salomon has touched, enriched, and changed countless lives.sked how he can possibly prepare for his almost endless string of public addresses and private counseling, he replies with his ready smile, ""I have been preparing for thirty years."" Indeed, his every talk reflects his lifetime pursuit of wisdom and service of G-d.
Now, for the first time, this great man's thought is captured between the covers of a book for English - speaking readers. Brilliantly prepared for publication by Rabbi Yaakov Yosef Reinman in consultation with the Mashgiach, these essays present his ideas in his own""voice"" on a variety of topics - that effect everyone's relationship with his G-d, his fellows and himself.
The writing is beautiful. the expression is eloquent. The message is relevant. This book is both timeless and timely - a rare value for every jewish home.

In his inimitable, down - to - earth style, the Mashgiach shows that all well - meaning, loving parents have the ability to bring up happy children who follow in their footsteps. His ideas are based on fundamental principles outlined in the teachings of Chazal and the sefarim of the Rishonim and Acharonim, and they are enriched by discussions and experiences with gedolei Yisrael of the past fifty years.The material in this book is drawn from a series of schmuessen the Mashgiach gave over a period of a year and a half. It was culled, arranged and adapted for print by Rabbi Yaakov Yosef Reinman, author of Shufra Dishtara and Abir Yosef al Hatorah, who has been learning b'chavrusa with the Mashgiach for many years. The collaboration of the Mashgiach's wisdom and eloquence and Rabbi Reinman's literary skills have produced an absolutely brilliant book.
""This volume is far and away the best chinuch book I have ever read, "" writes one reviewer.""It will change the face of Klal Yisrael for generations to come.""

A Torah Path To A Life of Success
You... are searching for meaning, for direction, for answers.You... have talent and doubts, confidence and fears.You... can discover the potential hidden with you - and YOU can succeed!This book - drawing upon the Torah's wisdom - will show you how.

As a managing director of the nation's largest investment bank, Rabbi Naftali Horowitz has learned a lot about the nature of success. As scion of a great Rabbinic family, he is also a man with a mission: to help Jews in any way he can. And help them he does: as a maggid shiur, as someone very active in kiruv, and by guiding literally tens of thousands of people to a greater understanding of themselves, their challenges, and their hidden potential, both in face-to-face meetings and in his popular lectures.
You... Revealed is not a typical self-help book for people looking for financial success - though it will certainly help them achieve that goal. Rather, it draws upon a wide range of Torah sources to help us discover our potential, our mission, and our purpose in life. It helps us identify the voices within us that tell us we are destined to fail, and gives us sharp retorts to counter those negative beliefs. It shows us how to make more of whatever gifts Hashem has given us.
You... Revealed combines profound Torah wisdom and time-tested mussar techniques with piercing psychological insights and fascinating true-life examples. It shows us how to achieve success while living lives of tranquility and contentment. It teaches us that success is not a function of what we do - it is a function of what we are! Most important of all, it shows us how to find the greatness that lies within each of us.
