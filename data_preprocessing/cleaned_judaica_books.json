Can we really find Truth in a corrupt world? Can we reach the highest places from our limited space? Can we taste eternity as mortal creatures? Can we touch heaven even as we stand on earth?

Yes we can rebuild. Indeed, we can find an even greater love than the original one. Yes, we can marry heaven and earth.

Success in business.Protection in times of danger. And, greatest of all, a way to strengthenour connection to Hashem. Yes, the blessings of bitachon are immeasurable.But how do we truly incorporate such trust in Hashem into our hearts?The Talmud Yerushalmi, the Zohar, the Maharal, and many othersources offer us a time-tested and effective means for embeddingbitachon firmly within us. The Maharal even states that this technique isa segulah for success in business and protection in times of war.What is this ultra-powerful technique?Pesukim of bitachon.That's right, pesukim, brief verses from Tanach.Reciting specific verses, these sources tell us, is an extremelypowerful way of incorporating bitachon - and all its blessings - intoevery aspect of our lives. Indeed, when we internalize these pesukim, wewill transform our very essence.Rav Yosef Zundel of Salant, the teacher of Rav Yisrael Salanter, listedspecific pesukim that strengthen our trust in G-d's providence, faith, andsalvation. In this groundbreaking work, Rabbi David Sutton examineseach of those pesukim, and gives us a greater understanding of the manylessons we can learn from them. Through stories and insights, he showsus how to use the pesukim to strengthen our bitachon. Each pasuk isfollowed by a brief \"Recap\" that helps us review the power of the pasuk,and a section with practical takeaways.Designed to be used as a daily reader, with one pasuk every day, in ADaily Dose of Pesukim of Bitachon we will discover the amazing powerof just a few words to transform our lives and lead us to the simchah, thejoy, that comes from living a life defined\u00a0by\u00a0bitachon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSku:\nDDOPBH\n\n\nAuthor:\nRabbi David Sutton\n\n\nIsbn 13:\n9781422640159\n\n\nIsbn 10:\n1422640159\n\n\nPages:\n435\n\n\nSize:\n6.3\" x 9.3\"\n\n\nBinding:\nHardcover\n\n\nDate:\n2/26/2024\n\n\nImprint:\nArtscroll Mesorah Publications\n\n\n", "option1": "Default Title", "option2": null, "option3": null, "sku": "DDOPBH", "requires_shipping": true, "taxable": true, "image": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0093/3625/8657/products/DDOPBH.jpg?v=1709087013", "available": true, "price": "25.99", "grams": 862, "compare_at_price": "29.99", "position": 1}, {"id": 31941800394849, "parent_id": 4543725568097, "handle": "f-932-2", "vendor": "Miriam Cohen", "tags": ["Author_Miriam Cohen", "Categories_Novels", "Novels"], "options": [{"name": "Title", "position": 1, "values": ["Default Title"]}], "title": "A Daughter of Two Mothers", "body_html": "Written by best - selling author Miriam Cohen, A Daughter of Two Mothers is the incredible, true account of a handicapped widow's forced separation from her infant daughter, the years of longing and searching, the legal battle, and the subsequent destruction brought by the Nazis.

And, of course, it's about great stories beautifully told.\nStories like Simi's, the freshly - minted CPA confronting illegal activity and an offer of a bribe. When her dream job becomes a nightmare she must choose between security... and her conscience. Stories like Mottel's, the philanthropist who takes a million dollar loan to keep his Tzedakah obligations, and who finds that Hashem Himself repays the money he owes. And stories like Arianna's, who discovers her stolen heritage in an unbelievable stroke of hashgacha pratis.\nAuthor C.B. Weinfeld has a knack for uncovering engrossing true accounts everywhere - in a tire factory, a pawn shop, a beis medrash. And as she shows us the greatness of other Jews we find, amazingly enough, that we can discover it in ourselves as well. When the sky is darkest, we see the stars' glow much more clearly.

We may even feel, in the depths of our despair, that even God has forgotten about us.\n The ultimate emergence from loneliness is through a consciousness that you are here for a unique reason and mission that only you can achieve.\n All of the Avos and Imahos were alone. From Avraham standing alone against a world of idol - worship to King David who was alone in his rejection by his family. Sarah was alone in her tent and Esther was alone in the palace of Achashverosh.\n How did they cope with their challenges of aloneness?\n Let us journey together through the Torah and Tanach, and discover a pathway to transform existential loneliness into empowering independence.\nApprobations:\n Each neshamah has a special role to play while traversing the path to reach his or her full potential in the service of Hashem. Rabbi Roll's new sefer discusses the Torah approach to transforming loneliness into uniqueness.- Rabbi Reuvein Feinstein\n Rabbi Roll seeks to alleviate the pain of those suffering from loneliness and depression.

Clearly, something terrible was happening downsouth. How could United Hatzalah send civilian volunteers to what was anactive war zone? But how could they abandon thousands of wounded Jews?The decision? They would warn every volunteer of the serious risks - andgive them permission to save lives.And so more than 1,700 volunteers donned their bright orange vests andsped down to the battleground of southern Israel.Bestselling author Rabbi Nachman Seltzer interviewed dozens of thosevolunteers, and here are their stories. The maggid shiur on his ambucyclewho braved a sniper's bullets to try and save a wounded policeman. Thevolunteer who took cover behind a tank while terrorists dressed as IDFsoldiers shot at him. The team who took care of twin babies who'd survived,though their parents had not.

And more: This unique commentary also includes close to 100 (!) stories, told in a way that only Rabbi Paysach Krohn can tell them.\nWhy did the lovely silver dish become a symbol of maror, of the bitterness of exile? How did Rav Hutner react at the Seder when a student spilled wine all over the Rosh Yeshivah's kittel? How did a young man's search for truth end up in a beautiful shidduch? In story after story, we see that many of the themes of the Seder play out in our own lives. We gain a better, deeper understanding of slavery and liberation, of faith and devotion.In this unique commentary, Rabbi Krohn invites us to enjoy a \"virtual Seder\" with him. In his own words: \"It is my hope and prayer that the stories and insights in this Haggadah will elevate and enhance your Seder, so that all at your table will take with them an exhilarating feeling of awe, joy, and gratitude....\"So join Rabbi Krohn At the Maggid's Seder, and see how much this Haggadah will enhance and enrich your own Seder as well.INCLUDES FULL HAGGADAH WITH ENGLISH TRANSLATION\nWatch the Inside Artscroll interview with the author, Rabbi Paysach Krohn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSku:\nHKROH\n\n\nAuthor:\nRabbi Paysach J.

Masters of Jewish thought, such as the Maharal, Ramchal, Rav Tzadok, and the Sfas Emes, provide us with deeper meaning and understanding of Torah, mitzvos, and life. Often, however, to fathom their teachings, it is necessary to have a broad knowledge and grasp of Torah and their works.Rabbi Ahron Rapps peels away the layers of darkness and shines penetrating light upon their lessons, providing his readers with a familiarity and keen awareness of their role in God's creation. His words shine forth as a menorah on a dark night, drawing us closer to vital concepts and holy acts.Prior to when he began his weekly column on these matters in the Yated, I did not know Rabbi Rapps. I turned to our rebbi, Rabbi Moshe Shapiro, zt\"l, for guidance as to whether to offer him a column. He accepted responsibility for Rabbi Rapps and greatly encouraged me to publish his columns.I am confident that he and the other great rebbeim of Rabbi Rapps are celebrating the publication of this work, which serves to further dispel the darkness of the exile and will lead to the return of the great light that will shine with the coming of Mashiach speedily in our day.Rabbi Pinchos Lipschutz\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSku:\nF-7015-1\n\n\nAuthor:\nRabbi Ahron Rapps\n\n\nIsbn 10:\n1952370159\n\n\nIsbn 13:\n9781952370151\n\n\nPages:\n156\n\n\nSize:\n6.3\" x 9.3\"\n\n\nBinding:\nHardcover\n\n\nDate:\n12/6/2020\n\n\nImprint:\nFeldheim Publishers\n\n\n", "option1": "Default Title", "option2": null, "option3": null, "sku": "F-7015-1", "requires_shipping": true, "taxable": true, "image": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0093/3625/8657/products/F-7015-1.jpg?v=1635957588", "available": true, "price": "17.99", "grams": 408, "compare_at_price": "18.99", "position": 1}, {"id": 40346704543943, "parent_id": 6829374963911, "handle": "elch", "vendor": "Sara Yoheved Rigler", "tags": ["Author_Sara Yoheved Rigler", "Biographies & Memoirs", "Categories_Biographies & Memoirs", "Categories_Inspirational & Short Stories", "Inspirational & Short Stories"], "options": [{"name": "Title", "position": 1, "values": ["Default Title"]}], "title": "Emunah With Love And Chicken Soup", "body_html": "The Machlis family hospitality is legendary. Every Shabbos they fit 150 or more people in their small Jerusalem living room, preparing for their guests over 40 chickens, three different kugels, countless salads, four desserts, and, of course, gefilte fish, chicken soup, and cholent - both traditional and vegetarian. Brooklyn - born Henny Machlis was at the heart of this amazing weekly adventure. But, as author Sara Yoheved Rigler, bestselling author of Holy Woman and a friend of Henny's, discovered as she interviewed Henny's fourteen children, relatives, students, and friends, the Shabbos hospitality was just one glowing facet of the multi - faceted diamond that was Rebbetzin Henny Machlis. A master of prayer, a virtuoso in chesed, an adept in childrearing, a wise Torah teacher, an expert at working on middos, and a successful shadchanit, Henny Machlis regarded a life of Torah and mitzvos as a great treasure that she was eager to share with everyone. And her emunah, her faith in G-d's love and providence? That was where her light shone the most brightly. She lived on the Planet of Emunah, a place where miracles were everyday occurrences, because she knew, really knew, that only Hashem is in charge and He can do anything. And, for Henny, He often did. Like a steaming bowl of chicken soup, this book will satisfy you. Comfort you. And heal you - in a way that only Rebbetzin Henny Machlis could. Sip it. Savor it.

And how if we believe in a child or talmid -indeed, in any person - he will learn to believe in himself.And, yes, we will learn how to believe in ourselves as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSku:\nFORTH\n\n\nAuthor:\nRabbi Yitzchok Herzberg\n\n\nIsbn 13:\n9781422632833\n\n\nIsbn 10:\n1422632830\n\n\nPages:\n369\n\n\nSize:\n6.3\" x 9.3\"\n\n\nBinding:\nHardcover\n\n\nDate:\n1/25/2023\n\n\nImprint:\nArtscroll Mesorah Publications\n\n\n", "option1": "Default Title", "option2": null, "option3": null, "sku": "FORTH", "requires_shipping": true, "taxable": true, "image": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0093/3625/8657/products/FORTH.jpg?v=1675041864", "available": true, "price": "25.99", "grams": 953, "compare_at_price": "29.99", "position": 1}, {"id": 43417525649607, "parent_id": 7771367309511, "handle": "br-12002", "vendor": "Harav Avigdor Miller", "tags": ["Author_Harav Avigdor Miller", "Bible Commentaries", "Categories_Bible Commentaries", "Categories_Weekly Parshah", "Weekly Parshah"], "options": [{"name": "Title", "position": 1, "values": ["Default Title"]}], "title": "Foundations and Principles of Bereishis", "body_html": "In Foundations and Principles of Bereishis, HaravAvigdor Miller delves into the profound teachings ofsefer Bereishis, uncovering its timeless wisdom andeternal significance.With meticulous scholarship and deep spiritual insight,this illuminating work explores the fundamentalthemes, characters, and events at the beginning oftime, offering readers a transformative journey throughcreation and the dawn of human history.Engaging and enlightening, this book is a cherishedguide for all those seeking a profound understanding ofthe Divine wisdom embedded in the opening chaptersof\u00a0the\u00a0Torah.\nSample Lecture: Test of Cain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSku:\nBR-12002\n\n\nAuthor:\nHarav Avigdor Miller\n\n\nIsbn 13:\n9781954350137\n\n\nIsbn 10:\n1954350139\n\n\nPages:\n589\n\n\nSize:\n6.7\" x 9.7\"\n\n\nBinding:\nHardcover\n\n\nDate:\n9/1/2023\n\n\nImprint:\nSimchas Hachaim Publishing\n\n\n", "option1": "Default Title", "option2": null, "option3": null, "sku": "BR-12002", "requires_shipping": true, "taxable": true, "image": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0093/3625/8657/products/BR-12002.jpg?v=1696959857", "available": true, "price": "27.99", "grams": 1134, "compare_at_price": "0.00", "position": 1}, {"id": 43116781306055, "parent_id": 7638080782535, "handle": "ibs-la342", "vendor": "Rabbi Gershon Weiss", "tags": ["Author_Rabbi Gershon Weiss", "Categories_Death & Mourning", "Categories_Jewish Law", "Death & Mourning", "Jewish Law"], "options": [{"name": "Title", "position": 1, "values": ["Default Title"]}], "title": "Foundations of Faith Haggadah", "body_html": "\nWith Commentary ofRav Gershon Weiss zt\"l\nIncludes\"Holocaust Connection\"\nGalus Mitzrayim was theforerunner of all of our People'ssubsequent exiles, forging a pathtoward the birth of our nationand its destiny throughout theages.

Rav Moshe ben Nachman was born in Spain in 1194/4934, andwas the crown of that country's golden age of Jewish scholarship forhis whole lifetime, until he was forced into exile because of his spiritedand intellectually successful battle against the strenuous efforts of theCatholic Church to convert Spain's Jews.He spent the last years of his enormously productive life writing hismonumental commentary on the Chumash, beginning it in Spain andcompleting it in Eretz Yisrael. Another gem of those final years wasIggeres HaRamban, the letter in which Ramban set forth eloquently andpithily the ethical principles by which his son should conduct himself.Just as Ramban's voluminous works have made us all his students, so hisLetter has made us all his children. Through the centuries, countless Jewshave made it their practice to study Iggeres HaRamban regularly: someread it and contemplate upon it every day; others do so every week orevery month.In this book, one of those students, Rabbi Avraham Chaim Feuer,shares with us what Ramban's Letter has taught him, for, like all the worksof the master, its every word and thought lends itself to introspection andinsight, to situations that face us every day in our personal and publiclives. Beginning with a user-friendly interlinear translation, the authorgoes on to comment on the Letter, and then gives a broad selection ofbeautiful and thought-provoking insights drawn from the millennia-longriches of rabbinic literature.By sharing with us what Ramban has taught him and the road map ofconduct upon which the Letter has led him, Rabbi Feuer becomes a guideand inspiration to the countless sons and daughters in all generations towhom Ramban's Letter\u00a0is\u00a0addressed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSku:\nIIGEH\n\n\nAuthor:\nRabbi Avrohom Chaim Feuer\n\n\nIsbn 13:\n9781422639474\n\n\nIsbn 10:\n1422639479\n\n\nPages:\n136\n\n\nSize:\n6.3\" x 9.3\"\n\n\nBinding:\nHardcover\n\n\nDate:\n9/21/2023\n\n\nImprint:\nArtscroll Mesorah Publications\n\n\n", "option1": "Default Title", "option2": null, "option3": null, "sku": "IIGEH", "requires_shipping": true, "taxable": true, "image": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0093/3625/8657/products/IIGEH.jpg?v=1695832283", "available": true, "price": "17.49", "grams": 363, "compare_at_price": "19.99", "position": 1}, {"id": 41322227007687, "parent_id": 7110015746247, "handle": "whagh", "vendor": "Rabbi Yonah Weinrib", "tags": ["Categories_Haggadahs", "Categories_Hebrew-English", "Haggadahs", "Hebrew-English", "Holiday", "Pesach"], "options": [{"name": "Title", "position": 1, "values": ["Default Title"]}], "title": "Illuminated Haggadah", "body_html": "Bring Pesach to life, with its dramatic images and vibrant messages!

Its history, origins, decline, and rebirth are simply fascinating. Furthermore, at its deepest level, Lashon HaKodesh is called such (\"the Holy Language\") because it is intrinsically sacred - and is thus unlike any other language known to Man.\nLashon HaKodesh: History, Holiness, & Hebrew seeks to understand the holiness of Lashon HaKodesh, follows its history, and focuses on the significance of Aramaic and other\"Jewish languages\" such as Yiddish and Ladino. An extended section is devoted to Modern Hebrew, its controversies, and its implications from a religious perspective. This unique work delves into the linguistic history of each\"Jewish language\", as well as the philological, Kabbalistic, and Halachic approaches to this topic taken by various Rabbinic figures through the ages. The author also compares and contrasts traditional Jewish views to those of modern - day academia,offering proofs and difficulties to both approaches.As the old saying goes, \"Two Jews, three opinions.\" In almost every chapter, more than one way of looking at the matter at hand is presented. In some cases, the differing opinions can be harmonized, but ultimately many matters remain subject to dispute. Hopefully, the mere knowledge of these sources will whet the reader's intellectual curiosity to learn more.Written by a brilliant young scholar, Lashon HaKodesh: History, Holiness, & Hebrew is ground - breaking, intriguing, and remarkable.\nAbout Author: Rabbi Reuven Chaim Klein is a graduate of Emek Hebrew Academy and Yeshiva Gedolah of Los Angeles. He is also a proud student of the Mir Yeshiva in Jerusalem and Beth Medrash Govoha in Lakewood. He received Rabbinic ordination from several leading figures in Jerusalem, including Rabbi Moshe Sternbuch, Rabbi Zalman Nechemia Goldberg, and Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Lerner.His writings havebeen published in several prestigious journals including Jewish Bible Quarterly (Jerusalem), Kovetz Hamaor (New York), Kovetz Kol HaTorah (London), and Kovetz Iyun HaParsha (Jerusalem). Most recently, this young scholar has dedicated time and efforts to researching the history and religious significance of Lashon HaKodesh.He is currently a fellow at the Kollel of Yeshivas Mir in Jerusalem and lives with his wife and children in Beitar Illit, Israel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSku:\nF-736-0\n\n\nAuthor:\nRabbi Reuven Chaim Klein\n\n\nIsbn 10:\n1937887545\n\n\nIsbn 13:\n9781937887544\n\n\nPages:\n294\n\n\nBinding:\nHardcover\n\n\nImprint:\nFeldheim Publishers\n\n\n", "option1": "Default Title", "option2": null, "option3": null, "sku": "F-736-0", "requires_shipping": true, "taxable": true, "image": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0093/3625/8657/products/F-736-0_34293cfc-0bfc-4926-a8f9-3b3e81e3e5ca.jpg?v=1635957878", "available": true, "price": "22.99", "grams": 635, "compare_at_price": "24.99", "position": 1}, {"id": 40346771226823, "parent_id": 6829385023687, "handle": "lobh", "vendor": "Rabbi Binyomin Forst,Rabbi Aaron D.

Rabbi Cohen has the rare gift of being able to take complex topics and make them understandable without talking down to the reader. Even more remarkably, he can, in the same volume, steer the layman through the maze of Halacha while enriching the scholar's understanding of the background issues and halachic sources, logic, and debates.In The Laws of Daily Living: The Three Weeks, Tisha B'Av, and Other FastsRabbi Cohen examines one of the most important - and surely the saddest - times of the Jewish year, when the Jewish People mourn the loss of the Temple and the Exile that followed. In his clear and authoritative manner he examines the laws of all the fast days (with the exception of Yom Kippur), the restrictions of the Three Weeks, the heightened sense of loss that builds up as we approach the Nine Days, and the climactic mourning of the Tishah B'Av fast.\nThe book is enriched and deepened by a discussion of the historical background of the momentous events that led to the Temple's destruction, based on the teachings of the author's grandfather, the renowned Rabbi Avigdor Miller zt'l. This adds a new and important dimension to the way we mark this period. With the best of intentions, it is not easy to mourn something that we never knew and hardly understand. Rabbi Miller's thought provides a moving and profound discussion of the Beis HaMikdash, its role in our lives, and the all - consuming loss that the Jewish People suffered with its destruction. Those who truly mourn the loss of the Temple, say our Sages, are destined to rejoice in its rebuilding. As we study and learn to properly follow the laws of these sad weeks, we bring that long - awaited moment ever closer.\n\n\n\n\nSku:\nLDTWH\n\n\nAuthor:\nRabbi Simcha Bunim Cohen\n\n\nIsbn 10:\n1422609073\n\n\nIsbn 13:\n9781422609071\n\n\nPages:\n224\n\n\nSize:\n6.3\" x 9.3\"\n\n\nBinding:\nHardcover\n\n\nDate:\n6/16/2009\n\n\nImprint:\nArtscroll Mesorah Publications\n\n\n", "option1": "Default Title", "option2": null, "option3": null, "sku": "LDTWH", "requires_shipping": true, "taxable": true, "image": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0093/3625/8657/products/907-3.jpg?v=1635962898", "available": true, "price": "23.99", "grams": 590, "compare_at_price": "28.99", "position": 1}, {"id": 40346771783879, "parent_id": 6829385285831, "handle": "lorh", "vendor": "R' Avrohom Pam,Rabbi Yisroel Reisman", "tags": ["Author_R' Avrohom Pam", "Author_Rabbi Yisroel Reisman", "Categories_Jewish Law", "Categories_Monetary Laws", "Jewish Law", "Monetary Laws"], "options": [{"name": "Title", "position": 1, "values": ["Default Title"]}], "title": "Laws of Ribbis", "body_html": "Ribbis?

His many books on the laws of Shabbos and child-rearing have become standard texts - enlightening, authoritative, and accessible - for scholar and layman alike.Now he turns his spotlight on an area that is in need of his unique clarity. The Yom Tov laws are a grey area, so to speak, because many of the Shabbos labors are permitted - but under limited circumstances. What are the circumstances? What are the limitations? What labors are sometimes permitted? Which are never of \"Yom Tov need\" permitted? May one always carry? What deg is sufficient to permit the labors that are sometimes permitted? Is one ever permitted to prepare food for the next day? The list of questions is long and perplexing.As always, Rabbi Cohen deals with the forest before turning to the trees. He explains the principles and parameters so that the reader has a clear understanding of the rules. Only then does he turn to specific cases. And, as is his forte, he deals with current situations, the sort of utensils and cases that one will not find spelled out clearly in the classic works of Halachah.A sefer such as this provides refreshing proof that the Torah is timeless, because the principles of every situation can be found in the Talmud and the codes - provided one has the background and understanding to find and apply them. Rabbi Cohen does, in full measure.This is a work that belongs in every Jewish home, alongside Rabbi Cohen's other works: The Shabbos Home, The Radiance of Shabbos, The Sanctity of Shabbos, The Shabbos Kitchen, and Children in Halachah.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSku:\nLOYH\n\n\nAuthor:\nRabbi Simcha Bunim Cohen\n\n\nIsbn 10:\n1578191629\n\n\nIsbn 13:\n9781578191628\n\n\nPages:\n315\n\n\nSize:\n6.3\" x 9.3\"\n\n\nBinding:\nHardcover\n\n\nDate:\n8/1/1997\n\n\nImprint:\nArtscroll Mesorah Publications\n\n\n", "option1": "Default Title", "option2": null, "option3": null, "sku": "LOYH", "requires_shipping": true, "taxable": true, "image": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0093/3625/8657/products/162-9.jpg?v=1635963076", "available": true, "price": "24.99", "grams": 726, "compare_at_price": "28.99", "position": 1}, {"id": 31941742657633, "parent_id": 4543698993249, "handle": "f-230-7", "vendor": "Rabbi Daniel Braude", "tags": ["Author_Rabbi Daniel Braude", "Categories_Jewish Law", "Categories_Shabbos", "Jewish Law", "Shabbos"], "options": [{"name": "Title", "position": 1, "values": ["Default Title"]}], "title": "Learn Shabbos in Just 3 Minutes A Day", "body_html": "This highly praised and comprehensive book on the laws of Shabbos is designed for daily learning.\n \n With its unique, easy - to - understand format, thousands of day - to - day practical examples, and user - friendly index, this book will be an indispensable reference for anyone who wants to study and know the laws of Shabbos...

The rest is in the Talmud, Midrash, and the classic commentators. If we could only pull all the disparate sources together into one flowing, coherent whole, we would have not only an absorbing and inspiring lesson in faith, we would enter the spine - tingling world of Mordechai and Esther - the intrigues of the royal court, the Machiavellian swamp of Haman's conspiracy, the thousands of talents of silver tumbling from Haman's hands to purchase the rights to history's first genocide, the bravery of Jewish children unafraid of death. We would exult with Mordechai on the royal steed, led through the streets of Shushan by his arch - enemy. Our hearts would pound as the uninvited Esther risks her life to plead with Ahasuerus - and succeeds!Yosef Deutsch puts us on the scene. He has accomplished the very impressive feat of canvassing all the sources and retelling the Purim story like a spellbinding novel - except that every word is true! In his narrative, the events come alive for us as never before. Every reader on every level will enjoy this book as a fascinating story and as a great learning experience. For the scholar, the author provides copious sources. For the rest of us, he gives the story of the Megillah with a sweep and level of interest that we have never experienced before.Read this book.

No matter what we have or don't have, no matter what we're going through, if we're at peace with ourselves and those around us, we can thrive.Nevertheless, each person is a world unto himself, and those worlds sometimes collide. Is there any way to build and protect the shalom that is so vital to our spiritual, emotional and material success?The Torah's wisdom overflows with insight and practical answers to this burning question. Live the Blessing brings the reader a daily dose of this wisdom, accompanied by a story that shows us how to incorporate the concept into our lives. Its chapters candidly confront the nitty-gritty of conflict and machlokes, including parent-child relationships, shalom bayis, divorce, business and community disputes. Its vital message: While differences are inevitable, personal enmity is not.This volume is packed with practical tools and expert advice. Each lesson suggests a step that readers can take to infuse their lives with shalom. Each chapter includes an interview with a rabbi, mental health professional or educator who provides an expert's perspective. The final chapter is a collection of materials that provide invaluable tools for securing the blessing of shalom for a lifetime.With one concise, content-packed lesson each day, this volume will transform the readers' perspectives and their lives, providing a realistic way to Live the Blessing that shalom brings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSku:\nSHALOMH\n\n\nAuthor:\nChofetz Chaim Heritage Foundation\n\n\nIsbn 10:\n1422626504\n\n\nIsbn 13:\n9781422626504\n\n\nPages:\n544\n\n\nSize:\n6.3\" x 9.3\"\n\n\nBinding:\nHardcover\n\n\nDate:\n7/16/2020\n\n\nImprint:\nArtscroll Mesorah Publications\n\n\n", "option1": "Default Title", "option2": null, "option3": null, "sku": "SHALOMH", "requires_shipping": true, "taxable": true, "image": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0093/3625/8657/products/650-4_3ca5e118-d73a-4ef6-8f29-909d68c16963.jpg?v=1635964705", "available": true, "price": "25.99", "grams": 1043, "compare_at_price": "29.99", "position": 1}, {"id": 43055976153287, "parent_id": 7616749961415, "handle": "lchh", "vendor": "Avrohom Asher Makovsky", "tags": ["Author_Avrohom Asher Makovsky", "Categories_Inspirational & Short Stories", "Inspirational & Short Stories"], "options": [{"name": "Title", "position": 1, "values": ["Default Title"]}], "title": "Living Chessed", "body_html": "\nPowerful stories and insightsto bring chessedinto our everyday livesChessed. It's in your hands. (And in your smile. Andmouth. And feet. And in countless other ways.)From the Talmud to the Rambam to the Chofetz Chaim - andmany other Torah sources - we learn how to deal with even themost challenging and turbulent times: la'asok b'Torah v'chessed. Tobusy ourselves with Torah learning and performing acts of chessed,kindness, to others.Of course, we all try to be \"nice\" to others, but to fill our daysand nights with chessed? Many of us imagine that to be the task ofthe great men and women who head up the organizations, createthe gemachs, raise the millions to feed and clothe the impoverished.But while that is certainly vital, Living Chessed shows us how we\"ordinary\" people can also be \"gedolim in chessed\" - just by grabbingthe countless opportunities to help our fellow Jews.In Living Chessed, Rabbi Avrohom Asher Makovsky shareswith us many Torah sources that talk about chessed, inspirationalinsights and guidance and, above all, stories of how chessed - evensomething small - can transform the lives of both the one givingand the one receiving the chessed. In brief, readable chapters, wewill discover the best segulah of all - not hurting someone's feelings.We will read about how the Tzemach Tzedek \"opened\" the gatesof heaven - by racing home to help another Jew in business. Howa man fulfilled his dream of having children by opening a free-loangemach. We will enjoy - and learn from! - story after story of peoplewho took the opportunity to help someone, often with something assimple as a compliment or even just a smile.\nLiving Chessed will show us how we can, indeed, \"live chessed\"throughout our days, enriching the lives of others.

What really lay behind Bigsan and Seresh's attempt to assassinate the king? What was the significance of Achashverosh's signet ring? Why did Mordechai refuse to bow, thus endangering his people?

We discuss, in detail, all the suffering that we endured in Mitzrayim, all the miracles Hashem did, and all the gratitude we have to Him for doing all this for us. We are expected to get into such detail that we can actually experience it ourselves, on this night, as if it were all happening to us, and to reach the level of joy and gratitude that the Jewish people had at the time of our exodus. This is supposed to bring us to a heightened level of emunah that will infuse our service of Hashem throughout the year.\"...Therefore, I have written this Sefer, to serve as an emunah primer for the Haggadah. To make the concepts of emunah readily available so that those leading the seder on this night can easily access them and share them with their family, which will inspire ourselves and, in turn, our children, in the joy of being a Yid.\"- Excerpt from Introduction\n\"The thrust of this commentary is to show how the basic theme of the Seder night is to show our emunah in, and our gratitude to, Hashem for our physical and spiritual redemption.

Their world is pure and idealistic, and their goals are spiritual. Their success is measured in the thrill of a new insight and the glimpses of Hashem's wisdom that only the Talmud can reveal. For some, the early years are only the beginning of a life - long ascent in the world of Torah. For most, however, a return trip to the material world is inevitable.This is one of the most difficult transitions a Ben Torah ever will make. It calls his entire identity and purpose into question. And yet little time is devoted to preparing for this transition in the years during which all energy is focused on Torah learning. Some get lost, and some feel misled; most are confused about how to proceed with their self - esteem and values intact.Rabbi Aaron Lopiansky has written a book that will serve as a guiding light to the many young men who are making this transition. He puts the Jew's ever - evolving life mission into clear perspective, helping readers plot a path of growth and elevation that will sustain them for the decades to come. He helps them cull the everlasting lessons they will take with them from their yeshiva years and ensure that these lessons translate cogently into their lives in business or a profession. This book is a groundbreaking addition to any Torah library and a lifeline for any young man taking his first tenuous steps outside the protective walls of yeshiva.\n\n\n\n\n\nSku:\nZB-975-3\n\n\nAuthor:\nRabbi Aaron Lopiansky\n\n\nIsbn 10:\n1614659753\n\n\nIsbn 13:\n9781614659754\n\n\nPages:\n256\n\n\nSize:\n6.3\" x 9.3\"\n\n\nBinding:\nHardcover\n\n\nDate:\n1/1/2018\n\n\nImprint:\nZ.

His classic commentary is the key to the understanding of the Mishnah and is the constant companion of all those who study Mishnayos. But as his letters reveal, he was also an intrepid traveller who exposed himself to the dangers of disease and pirates in order to live in the Holy City of Jerusalem. In the late fifteenth century, Jerusalem was at one of its lowest points, depleted by war, plague and rapacious authorities. Rabbi Ovadiah's arrival brought hope and encouragement to the existing communities and gradually attracted newcomers, many of them Italian Jews who sought to be his students. One of these students is the author of the final letter in this volume. Thanks to a promise made to his father to describe all the communities he visited, we have a remarkable record of the Jewish communities of Italy, Greece and Egypt, as well as those of Eretz Yisrael. These travel letters, originally published in Hebrew under the title Darkei Zion, are now presented in English, for the first time, in a lucid and highly readable translation entitled Pathway to Jerusalem. It is one of the most valuable historical sources for the period, as well as a very interesting book for the lay reader. The bravery and dedication of Rabbi Ovadiah of Bartenura and his contemporaries makes for fascinating and inspirational reading.

It has the power to invigorate our avodas Hashem and make the Jewish faith a living reality, for ourselves and our children.But how can we find new meaning in a story we already know? Many of us search through stacks of Haggados for insights that will add depth to our Seder experience. Without realizing it, we lose sight of the story itself, and its life-changing messages escape us.\nThe Pesach Haggadah: Living Our History shows us that the meaning we search for lies in the words of the Haggadah themselves. It reveals the hidden depth of the story we thought we knew, and shows its personal relevance to the life of every Jew.Rabbi Reuven Leuchter, a prominent disciple of Rabbi Shlomo Wolbe zt\"l, is one of the leading educators and baalei mussar of our generation. Rabbi Leuchter has served as Mashgiach in several yeshivos. Today, he heads a kollel for budding scholars, and delivers shiurim and mussar \"vaadim\" throughout Israel and abroad. In addition, he trains future rabbis for rabbinic or kiruv careers with Ner Le'Elef.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSku:\nF-5111-1\n\n\nAuthor:\nRabbi Reuven Leuchter,Eran Feintuch\n\n\nIsbn 10:\n1680251112\n\n\nIsbn 13:\n9781680251111\n\n\nPages:\n133\n\n\nSize:\n8.3\" x 8.7\"\n\n\nBinding:\nHardcover\n\n\nDate:\n3/28/2019\n\n\nImprint:\nFeldheim Publishers\n\n\n", "option1": "Default Title", "option2": null, "option3": null, "sku": "F-5111-1", "requires_shipping": true, "taxable": true, "image": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0093/3625/8657/products/F-5111-1.jpg?v=1635956897", "available": true, "price": "15.99", "grams": 538, "compare_at_price": "16.99", "position": 1}, {"id": 39313731518663, "parent_id": 6552949981383, "handle": "c-kv203", "vendor": "Yoinesen Schwartz", "tags": ["Author_Yoinesen Schwartz", "Categories_Yiddish", "Yiddish"], "options": [{"name": "Title", "position": 1, "values": ["Default Title"]}], "title": "Pesach Mit Di Kinder Velt - \u05e4\u05e1\u05d7 \u05de\u05d9\u05d8 \u05d3\u05d9 \u05e7\u05d9\u05e0\u05d3\u05e2\u05e8 \u05d5\u05d5\u05e2\u05dc\u05d8", "body_html": "\n\n\u05e2\u05b6\u05e8\u05b6\u05d1 \u05e4\u05e1\u05d7\n\u05dc\u05d9\u05dc \u05d4\u05b7\u05e1\u05b5\u05d3\u05b6\u05e8\n\u05d4\u05b7\u05d2\u05b0\u05d3\u05b8\u05d4\n\u05d7\u05d5\u05b9\u05dc \u05d4\u05b7\u05de\u05d5\u05b9\u05e2\u05b5\u05d3\u05e1\u05d9\u05de\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d4\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8, \u05de\u05d4 \u05e0\u05e9\u05ea\u05e0\u05d4, \u05d2\u05e2\u05e9\u05e8\u05d9\u05d1\u05df \u05d0\u05d9\u05df \u05d2\u05e2\u05d6\u05d9\u05e0\u05d2\u05e2\u05df.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSku:\nC-KV203\n\n\nAuthor:\nYoinesen Schwartz\n\n\nIsbn 13:\n9781950793600\n\n\nIsbn 10:\n1950793605\n\n\nPages:\n80\n\n\nSize:\n8.7\" x 11.3\"\n\n\nBinding:\nHardcover\n\n\nDate:\n3/1/2021\n\n\nImprint:\nKinder Velt\n\n\n", "option1": "Default Title", "option2": null, "option3": null, "sku": "C-KV203", "requires_shipping": true, "taxable": true, "image": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0093/3625/8657/products/C-KV203.jpg?v=1683554497", "available": true, "price": "28.99", "grams": 635, "compare_at_price": "0.00", "position": 1}, {"id": 39313731354823, "parent_id": 6552949883079, "handle": "n-69340y", "vendor": "Teacher Toby", "tags": ["Author_Teacher Toby", "Categories_Yiddish", "Yiddish"], "options": [{"name": "Title", "position": 1, "values": ["Default Title"]}], "title": "Pesach Mit Di Mitzvah Kinder - \u05e4\u05e1\u05d7 \u05de\u05d9\u05d8 \u05d3\u05d9 \u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05d4 \u05e7\u05d9\u05e0\u05d3\u05e8", "body_html": "\n\u05d4\u05b7\u05db\u05b8\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea \u05e6\u05d5\u05bc\u05dd \u05e4\u05b6\u05e1\u05b7\u05d7\n\u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05ea \u05d4\u05b7\u05d2\u05b8\u05d3\u05d5\u05b9\u05dc\n\u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05d3\u05b4\u05d9\u05e7\u05ea / \u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05e8\u05b5\u05d9\u05e4\u05b7\u05ea \u05d7\u05b8\u05de\u05b5\u05e5\n\u05e1\u05b5\u05d3\u05b6\u05e8 \u05e0\u05b8\u05d0\u05db\u05b0\u05d8\n\u05e7\u05b0\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05e2\u05b7\u05ea \u05d9\u05b7\u05dd \u05e1\u05d5\u05bc\u05e3\u05d3\u05b6\u05e2\u05dd \u05d4\u05b5\u05d9\u05d9\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d2\u05b0\u05df \u05e1\u05b6\u05d3\u05b6\u05e8 \u05e0\u05b7\u05d0\u05db\u05b0\u05d8 \u05d2\u05b6\u05e2\u05d3\u05b6\u05e2\u05e0\u05b0\u05e7\u05b6\u05e2\u05df,\u05e6\u05d5\u05bc\u05dd \u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05dd \u05d8\u05d5\u05b9\u05d1 \u05e4\u05b6\u05bc\u05e1\u05b7\u05d7 \u05d6\u05b4\u05d9\u05da \u05d2\u05b6\u05e2\u05e0\u05b0\u05e7\u05b6\u05e2\u05df,\u05d0\u05b7\u05d6\u05d5\u05d9 \u05d5\u05d5\u05d9 \u05d1\u05b5\u05bc\u05d9\u05d9 \u05d9\u05b0\u05e6\u05b4\u05d9\u05d0\u05b7\u05ea \u05de\u05b4\u05e6\u05b0\u05e8\u05b7\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd,\u05d5\u05b6\u05d5\u05e2\u05dc\u05b0\u05df \u05de\u05b4\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d2\u05b4\u05d9\u05d9\u05df \u05e7\u05b5\u05d9\u05d9\u05df \u05d9\u05b0\u05e8\u05d5\u05bc\u05e9\u05b8\u05c1\u05dc\u05b7\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd!\n\n\n\n\n\nSku:\nN-69340Y\n\n\nAuthor:\nTeacher Toby\n\n\nBarcode:\n659499693400\n\n\nPages:\n48\n\n\nSize:\n8.7\" x 11.3\"\n\n\nBinding:\nHardcover\n\n\nDate:\n3/1/2021\n\n\nImprint:\nMitzvah Kinder\n\n\n", "option1": "Default Title", "option2": null, "option3": null, "sku": "N-69340Y", "requires_shipping": true, "taxable": true, "image": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0093/3625/8657/products/N-69340Y.jpg?v=1645139024", "available": true, "price": "34.99", "grams": 635, "compare_at_price": "0.00", "position": 1}, {"id": 31941805572193, "parent_id": 4543727468641, "handle": "f-sed-c", "vendor": "Feldheim Publishers", "tags": ["Categories_Holiday Books", "Categories_Shiurim Cards", "Holiday", "Holiday Books", "Pesach", "Pesach Books", "Shiurim Cards"], "options": [{"name": "Title", "position": 1, "values": ["Default Title"]}], "title": "Pesach Seder Measurement Chart - Laminated", "body_html": "The Torah has given specific quantities for the Mitzvos of the Seder, and in order to fulfill these Mitzvos, both men and women must eat no less than the required amounts.

This is primarily based on the verse in Exodus 1:11 that describes the Israelites building the store-city of Ramesses during their years of oppression.HOWEVER, THIS IDENTIFICATION POSES PROBLEMS. It does not fit in with the number of years stipulated by the Bible between the Exodus and the construction of the Second Temple by Darius the Great, the Persian monarch and ruler of the 27th Dynasty in Egypt. Furthermore, over the last couple of decades, archaeologists and researchers have uncovered a wealth of evidence contradicting this identification.ANOTHER BAFFLING PROBLEM that traditional Jewish dating sets the beginning of the Egyptian Dynastic era at circa 2000 BCE, the painstaking conventional chronologists yields a date of whereas analysis of circa 3000 BCE.In this fascinating study, bestselling author Rabbi Alexander Hool (The Challenge of Jewish History, Mosaica Press, 2014, and Searching for Sinai, Mosaica Press, 2017) draws on fascinating research from many different disciplines as well as startling astronomical evidence to establish the convergence of a new Egyptian chronology in line with traditional Jewish dating.In addition, the path of investigation yields a surprising and penetrating insight into the setting of the Exodus, and this results in the contraction of Egyptian history by-incredibly-almost a thousand years!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSku:\nF-5196-8\n\n\nAuthor:\nAlexander Hool\n\n\nIsbn 10:\n1946351962\n\n\nIsbn 13:\n9781946351968\n\n\nPages:\n283\n\n\nSize:\n7.7\" x 10.3\"\n\n\nBinding:\nHardcover\n\n\nDate:\n3/23/2020\n\n\nImprint:\nFeldheim Publishers\n\n\n", "option1": "Default Title", "option2": null, "option3": null, "sku": "F-5196-8", "requires_shipping": true, "taxable": true, "image": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0093/3625/8657/products/F-5196-8.jpg?v=1635957060", "available": true, "price": "27.99", "grams": 1179, "compare_at_price": "29.99", "position": 1}, {"id": 40346805141703, "parent_id": 6829389840583, "handle": "pirp-p", "vendor": "Rabbi Meir Zlotowitz", "tags": ["Author_Rabbi Meir Zlotowitz", "Categories_Pirkei Avos", "Pirkei Avos"], "options": [{"name": "Title", "position": 1, "values": ["Default Title"]}], "title": "Pirkei Avos & Birchas Hamazon - Pocket Size", "body_html": "Avos is a book of ethics, honesty, and advice.

That unique form of communication between us and our Creator; the connection that brings us close to Him while simultaneously effecting our own yeshuos.But prayer doesn't always come naturally to us, especially when we have a hard time understanding or relating to the tefillos. Portraits of Prayer's goal is to change that.In this second volume of Portraits of Prayer, the tefillos of Birchos Krias Shema through Shemoneh Esrei, as well as the tefillos after Shemoneh Esrei, are explored and beautifully explained. Fascinating and inspiring stories abound throughout the pages, bringing to life the verses from the siddur that we say each day, and helping us see the relevance of these words to our own reality.As with Volume 1 of this highly-in-demand series, you'll find yourself turning to Portraits of Prayer frequently as a way to connect to your tefillos...and to your Father in Heaven.HASHEM GAVE RAV ELIEZER ABISH a tremendous zechus; he has accomplished a wonderful thing.  After the Beis Hamikdosh was destroyed, we weren't able to bring korbanos anymore, but Hashem said that tefillos are more precious to Him than korbanos. What a wonderful zechus he has to present the tefillos in a way that is appealing to people, thereby assisting them to appreciate their davening.-Harav Gamliel Rabinovitch, Rosh Hayeshivah, Yeshivah Hamekubalim Sha'ar Hashamayim, YerushalayimIT IS CRITICAL for our generation that people enjoy their davening; that they understand and find deep meaning in their tefillos.

Or, you've come to the conclusion of a delicious barbecue with your best friends together at the table. And now, you want to appreciatively express your thanks to Hashem. So you announce, \"Let's Bentch!\" But, do we really do justice to the Biblical expression of bentching? The Chofetz Chaim assures us the rewards for bentching are grand! He reveals that if we bentch correctly we will be blessed with a livelihood of plenty and dignity all of our days.\n \n Rabbi Moshe Meir Weiss takes us on a journey through the familiar pathways of bentching and reveals to us many hidden gems lurking behind the familiar words we chant every day. So much of our communication with Hashem is done when we are in a rush. But, when we sit back after a pleasant dessert at our tables, we can indulge, with Rabbi Weiss's help, in some serious connectivity with our Creator. Rabbi Weiss shows us how we are not just thanking Hashem for our food but also for our clothing, our homes, our digestive systems, our modern conveniences and much, much more. He explains the connections between our food and Eretz Yisroel, the linkage between our meals, the Torah, and family unity.\n \n There is something in this remarkable sefer for everyone, scholar and novice alike. This new hardcover edition is enhanced with outtakes on every other page to spark family conversations and introspections. One of the challenges of Torah study is the problem of retention since we have very little time to dedicate to review. The beauty of embarking on the study of bentching is that we can review Rabbi Weiss\u00b0\u00aas lessons over and over every time we bentch. Rabbi Weiss, with meticulous research, explains to us meanings behind every single word in the bentching. For example, he shows us the subtle differences between such words as\"re'einu, zuneinu, parnaseinu, v'chalkileinu.\"\n \n As Yehudim (of which the root word means\"to thank\"), we are the People who specialize in giving thanks. With this treasured sefer, we will indeed become talented at this vital art. Then, the next time we bentch, Hashem will say, \"I see you really appreciate it. It's a pleasure doing business with you. I will shower you with even more of My Divine largesse.\" So, come join us for a journey with Rabbi Moshe Meir Weiss, one that will enhance your tables, and your lives, for many years to come.\n \n What our Gedolim are saying about Power Bentching:\n \n\"an exhaustive source, filled with the words of Chazal and great commentators, many parables and aneCDotes from our great leaders, as well as wise ethical lessons for everyone\" - Rabbi Reuven Feinstein, shlit\"a\n \n\"The sefer is packed with the fundamentals of Yiddishkeit and the traditions of our holy ancestors\" - Novominsker Rebbe, Rabbi Yaakov Perlow, shlit\"a\n \n\"a valuable and important sefer on the topic of Birchas Hamazon\" - Skolya Rebbe, Rabbi Avrohom M.

In this retrospective sense, it\"faces backwards.\" \n On the other hand, however, it also\"faces forwards\" in the sense that it provides a vision toward the future. It contains many messages that reveal extremely profound concepts and fundamental truths... the festival of Purim is a time when these ideas can be encountered, accessed, and absorbed anew.\n Ultimately, these two different\"directions\" do not conflict with each other, for the day of Purim is not just a historical event; it is an ongoing presence in the Jewish calendar and in its national experience.\n Behind the feasting and merriment which accompany the day of Purim lie some of the most profound and meaningful ideas of Judaism. Drawing on a fascinating array of sources, renowned teacher and author Rabbi Immanuel Bernstein (author of the bestselling Teshuva, Aggadah, and Darkness to Destiny Haggadah) guides the reader on an eye - opening journey towards a deeper appreciation of the Jewish people's most Multicolor festival.\nApprobations:\n\"It is known that the festival of Purim is both concealed and exalted, its laws and customs are hidden and mystifying. In this unique sefer, the author explains the essence of the day as well as the avodah which accompanies it.\"\n- Harav Osher Weiss\n \n\"I thank you for this major contribution to the appreciation of Purim...

In some places those questions are encouraged and discussed openly. In some places those questions are whispered and hidden. I hope you have at least one adult you can speak to with your questions. Questions are good! The whole process of learning Torah is based on questions! If you're not asking questions then how do we know if you're really engaged in what we're doing? And not asking the questions out loud doesn't make the questions go away. It makes them roll around in your head until they make quite the racket. Sometimes teens don't ask because they think their questions are so powerful that if they got out the whole system of Torah will crumble under the weight of the question. Well, wonderful and important teenager, that is wholly unlikely.So this book is about questions teens like to ask. We'll try to explore some thinking on the big topics: davening, faith, working with parents that are complicated, Hashem, Torah, the purpose of life, that sort of thing. Maybe you'll like my answers. Maybe you'll have more questions. That's great. Ask them. You deserve really great answers. You are, after all, the most important thing in all of creation.Okay, let's jump right in.

Rav Miller left behind a vast legacy of recorded shiurim and writings. Now, thanks to the efforts of Rabbi Yaakov Astor, an important part of that legacy has been transformed into this monumental book.\n\nThe themes of emunah and bitachon permeated a great many of Rav Miller's shiurim and seforim, but the material was scattered in many different places and was thus hard to access. Now, that eye-opening material has been collected, assembled and organized into a fascinating question-and-answer book, a book that will answer your questions and bring you clarity when you need it most. Rav Miller's bold, straightforward approach sheds a brilliant light on the most troubling, thorny issues that confront us.

Any cough or sneeze, any groan of fatigue or sound of pain from a stubbed toe had to be stifled, however much it hurt them...\nThe Steipler dragged his tired feet along behind, trying to follow another bochur in the darkness. His thoughts were wrapped up in a passage from the Gemara and this gave him strength and comfort...\nIn this way the night passed, slowly and painfully, and so did part of the next day.

He davened with such absorption that he did not notice that the others in his group had moved on and left him completely alone, with no idea of where he was...Such was the incredible devotion of the Steipler Gaon, zatzal, to Torah and mitzvos, a sense of devotion so total that it enabled him to concentrate his energies solely on the service of Hashem, day in day out, oblivious to whatever circumstances he found himself in.

Surprisingly, he did so without almost ever leaving the confines of his little shul in Brooklyn.\n\n\nDespite being born in early twentieth century America, attending public school, and growing up in an environment focused solely on materialism and assimilation, Rav Miller somehow managed to resist the powerful tides of his youth. The path of hatshgachah - a reflection of his own determination to serve Hashem with all his heart - took him to the Yeshivah Eitz Chaim in New York, to the legendary Slabodka yeshivah in Europe, to Chelsea, Massachusetts, to serve as Rav, to Mesivta Rabbeinu Chaim Berlin as Mashgiach, and finally to East Flatbush and later Flatbush as the Rav of a small kehillah.\n\n\nAlong that path, he never stopped working on himself, and he never stopped learning and teaching Torah. One thought at a time, one small action at a time, Rav Miller transformed himself into a supreme eved Hashem. One word at a time, one shiur at a time, Rav Miller transformed virtually every Jew who came in contact with him. His mind-expanding, eye-opening Thursday night lectures - disseminated around the world through his tape recordings - changed the lives of Jews everywhere. His patient, methodical Gemara shiurim turned those who at first could only read from a siddur into accomplished talmidei chachamim. His numerous published books enriched readers with the gift of refreshing clarity as they conveyed hard-hitting, no-nonsense Torah hashkafah.\n\n\nThe story of Rav Miller's life - presented here for the first time in a fascinating, comprehensive biography - is a testimony to the power we all have to transform ourselves, and our world. Rav Avigdor Miller's shiurim on Simchas Hachaim Publishing\n\n\nThis book is a labor of love by a devoted talmid. Although it is a comprehensive biography, it didn't begin that way. It began as a collection of aneCDotes about Rav Miller that demonstrated how the lessons he taught in his mussar vaadim were \"living lessons\" - what he called his \"program for life.\" To the small groups of b'nei Torah who attended his vaadim, Rav Miller actually revealed the system that helped him become a gadol.\n\n\nThat small collection of aneCDotes ultimately grew into this comprehensive work. But its unusual origin sheds light on what sets it apart. It paints an astonishing picture of how a revolutionary gadol B'Yisrael developed from humble beginnings through myriad tiny steps. It is thus a testimony and, even more so, a guidebook to how real transformation occurs....\n\n\n\n\nSku:\nJP-RAMH\n\n\nAuthor:\nYaakov Y.

More: He built individual talmidim. Because he personallywent through the painstaking process of self-discovery and growth, he wasable to identify with the struggles and triumphs of his talmidim in a way thatfew could.The last years of life were akin to a flame that burns increasingly brightbefore it is extinguished.

Rabbi Spero's best - selling\"Touched by...\" series has earned him many thousands of admiring readers. In this, his first biography, he outdoes himself.\nTo Rav Gifter, every minute of Torah was a precious gift. His intense and successful effort to master the Torah was phenomenal. All his life he carried with him - and personified - the memories of his mentors and his years in the Telz Yeshivah in Lithuania. He was a peerless orator, who moved listeners to tears and inspired them to scale heights. He had an awesome sense of responsibility to the yeshivah, the community, and even to the youngest talmid and most humble petitioner - he made time for everyone. Most of all, he loved Torah. It was his life's goal - and his contagious zeal for learning created legions of talmidei chachamim in his image.\nHe interacted with the greatest sages of the era and was a fearless champion in the intellectual battles for the truth of Torah. And he was tender and understanding with the Jewishly unlearned US Navy veteran who stumbled into Telz, and the college girl searching for an Orthodox prayer experience. Students were awed by his intensity, but warmed by his tender and loving embrace.\nHe described himself as a\"simple melamed\" a teacher. His mission was to master Torah and transmit it in all its grandeur. He succeeded.\nThe book is lavishly illustrated, including many never - before published photographs. And it is filled with Rav Gifter's ideals, teachings, perspectives, and classic orations, in his own words.\nWhen he was a teenager, his wall was adorned with pictures of Torah giants - and there was one empty frame with the words\"What about you? \" The youngster from Portsmouth answered the question with his own magnificent life.\nRead about him.

A member of Eretz Yisrael's Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah. A master educator who influenced literally thousands of talmidim, from pre-schoolers to respected mechanchim. He was a close confidante of Rav Elyashiv, and part of a family that included some of the greatest names in pre-war Europe.And it all started in a public school in Pittsburgh.R' Yitzchak Scheiner's journey from a Pittsburgh high school to his simple Yerushalmi home and the hallowed halls of Kamenitz Yeshivah is a story of breathtaking hashgachah pratis. It is a story, also, of the dedicated people who enabled the budding math and Latin scholar to become a gadol b'Torah. His parents, who defied the odds and lived a Torah-observant life in a time and place where that was exceptionally rare. The meshulach who visited the Scheiner home and told his astonished parents that yes, there were yeshivahs even in America. His rabbanim: R' Shraga Feivel Mendelovitch, R' Shloime Heiman, and R' Reuven Grozovsky. And the rebbe he never met but learned so much from: Rav Baruch Ber Leibowitz, \"der zeide\" whose granddaughter he married, and whose illustrious legacy he carried on for almost eighty years.Based on dozens of interviews with talmidim, mechanchim, and family members, Rabbi Nachman Seltzer paints a vivid and absorbing portrait of Rav Scheiner as an incomparable mechanech, a loving father to his own children and his talmidim, a man of incredible sensitivity and integrity.By his teachings and personal example, Rav Yitzchok Scheiner influenced many thousands. Now, with the publication of this biography, he continues to teach - and inspire - all of us with his shining example of gadlus.\n\nWatch: The American Boy\u2026Who Grew to Greatness!\n\n\nWatch: Rabbi Nachman Seltzer on the Inspiring Journey to Greatness of Rav Yitzchok Scheiner zt\"l\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSku:\nRYSH\n\n\nAuthor:\nRabbi Nachman Seltzer\n\n\nIsbn 10:\n1422630994\n\n\nIsbn 13:\n9781422630990\n\n\nPages:\n392\n\n\nSize:\n6.3\" x 9.3\"\n\n\nBinding:\nHardcover\n\n\nDate:\n2/16/2022\n\n\nImprint:\nArtscroll Mesorah Publications\n\n\n", "option1": "Default Title", "option2": null, "option3": null, "sku": "RYSH", "requires_shipping": true, "taxable": true, "image": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0093/3625/8657/products/RYSH.jpg?v=1644961935", "available": true, "price": "25.99", "grams": 862, "compare_at_price": "29.99", "position": 1}, {"id": 43369977086151, "parent_id": 7751524712647, "handle": "rayh", "vendor": "Rabbi Chaim Aryeh Zev Ginzberg", "tags": ["Author_Rabbi Chaim Aryeh Zev Ginzberg", "Categories_Jewish Thought", "Jewish Thought"], "options": [{"name": "Title", "position": 1, "values": ["Default Title"]}], "title": "Rays of Hope", "body_html": "\nFinding ChizukIn Challenging Times\nRabbi Chaim Aryeh Zev Ginzberg is a beloved rav inCedarhurst who has engaged thousands of readers overthe course of decades with his incisive articles in the Torahworld's most prestigious periodicals.

He resolved unsolvable problems, healed the incurably ill, and warmed souls numb with cold. In that small town, fiery Chassidim found truth, and hungry travelers found nourishment. The Rebbe - who labored in Torah, poured out his heart in prayer, and seemed to exist in a realm of his own between heaven and earth - would stop everything if a Jew needed a cold drink or warm bed, would cease his holy toil to help another. He belonged to the people, and they to him. A generation loved and revered the tzaddik of Kerestir, and they transmitted this veneration to their children, who in turn passed it down to their children.\nToday, more than ninety years after the passing of Reb Shayele, his stories, image, and teachings still serve as a source of blessing and healing to multitudes. Thousands converge on his burial place each year on his yahrtzeit, and those connecting with his ideals and message feel the force of his merit accompanying them. The Hebrew - language volume, Moifes HaDor, was a novelty: pulsating with emunas tzaddikim, well researched and precise as an academic journal.\nWithin months of its release, a new printing was needed, and then another. The Yiddish language version best - seller was greeted with similar enthusiasm, sold - out in record time to a readership eager to hear about the tzaddik, to own a book which is itself a source of blessing.\nThis is the first English - language work to tell the story: like the town itself, you will not leave the same as you arrived. You will be ushered into the peaceful town on the banks of the Bodrog River, moved by tales of hospitality and kindness, awed by the extraordinary that was ordinary in Kerestir - and just as then - blessed by a connection to this tzaddik.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSku:\n\nF-5285-9\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n\nRabbi Yisroel Besser\n\n\n\nIsbn 10:\n\n1680252852\n\n\n\nIsbn 13:\n\n9781680252859\n\n\n\nSize:\n\n6\" x 9\"\n\n\n\nBinding:\n\nHardcover\n\n\n\nImprint:\n\nFeldheim Publishers\n\n\n\n", "option1": "Default Title", "option2": null, "option3": null, "sku": "F-5285-9", "requires_shipping": true, "taxable": true, "image": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0093/3625/8657/products/F-5285-9.jpg?v=1652402123", "available": true, "price": "30.99", "grams": 803, "compare_at_price": "32.99", "position": 1}, {"id": 43363909796039, "parent_id": 7748867719367, "handle": "jp-rbsh", "vendor": "Eytan Kobre", "tags": ["Author_Eytan Kobre", "Biographies & Memoirs", "Categories_Biographies & Memoirs"], "options": [{"name": "Title", "position": 1, "values": ["Default Title"]}], "title": "Reb Shmuel", "body_html": "\nThe Life of Rav Shmuel Aurbach~ Learning, Loving, and Leading ~\n\"This Book Is A Masterpiece - an authoritative, comprehensive, andexcellently written portrayal of the life of an individual who reached immenseheights of spiritual perfection.

Even those who can sense Eretz Yisrael's spiritual power often thirst for a deeper, more meaningful relationship with the land.What is the nature of the kedushah of Eretz Yisrael? How can we be inspired by it? How can we - as tourists, as students learning for a year or more, or even as residents in Eretz Yisrael - take advantage of the great opportunity of being in Hashem's beloved land? Sacred Soil, by Harav Moshe Wolfson shlita, a revered Torah leader of our generation, examines the spiritual riches of Eretz Yisrael and its mekomos ha'kedoshim.Join Rav Wolfson on a tour of Yerushalayim's spiritual essence. Understand the secret of the Kosel's eternity, discover the hidden message that Mearas HaMachpelah whispers to every Jew. Learn why Rachel is buried apart from Yaakov and how this should affect our prayers at her burial site. Experience the ecstasy of Miron, hear the song of Yam Kinneres, and connect to the Arizal in the elevated mountains of Tzefas. Appreciate the power of tefilah at the burial site of Chana and Shmuel HaNavi, be surprised at Yam HaMelach, learn an important lesson from Shimon Hatzaddik and hear the prayer of Yaakov for our generation at the tomb of Shimshon HaGibbor.Whether you are traveling to Eretz Yisrael for a short trip, a year - or even a lifetime - make sure to pack Sacred Soil with you, to ensure that you understand, and feel, the kedushah of this land that is like no other.\n\n\n\nSku:\nSSOH\n\n\nAuthor:\nRabbi Moshe Wolfson,Baila Vorhand\n\n\nIsbn 10:\n1422619249\n\n\nIsbn 13:\n9781422619247\n\n\nPages:\n424\n\n\nSize:\n6.3\" x 9.3\"\n\n\nBinding:\nHardcover\n\n\nDate:\n8/16/2017\n\n\nImprint:\nArtscroll Mesorah Publications\n\n\n", "option1": "Default Title", "option2": null, "option3": null, "sku": "SSOH", "requires_shipping": true, "taxable": true, "image": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0093/3625/8657/products/924-9.jpg?v=1635965149", "available": true, "price": "24.99", "grams": 862, "compare_at_price": "28.99", "position": 1}, {"id": 40557757923527, "parent_id": 6829391216839, "handle": "ra1h", "vendor": "Rabbi Yisrael Herczeg", "tags": ["Author_Rabbi Yisrael Herczeg", "Bible", "Categories_Chumash", "Chumash"], "options": [{"name": "Volume", "position": 1, "values": ["Bereishis", "Shemos", "Vayikra", "Bamidbar", "Devarim"]}], "title": "Bereishis", "body_html": "Rashi's classic commentary on the Torah, presented with a level of clarity and understanding you never thought possible.

I presumed that it was some kind of a preliminary meeting for a shidduch, so I got my jacket and tie and went to his house. When I got there I saw that there was no one home but him.\"Did the Rosh Yeshiva call me for a meeting?\" I asked.\"Yes. I called you for a meeting with your yetzer ha\u02bcra,\" he answered.\"Why does the Rosh Yeshiva think I have a yetzer ha'ra? I am keeping up with the learning schedule that the Rosh Yeshiva made for me. What am I doing wrong?\"Rav Isaac answered, \"Don't be offended when I tell you that you have a yetzer ha'ra. We all have a yetzer ha'ra. The only question is how we deal with it.\"\n\n\nRav Shlomo Hoffman zt\"l was a student of Kthe Chevron Yeshiva seventy to eighty years ago. He was among those who established a close connection with Rav Isaac Sher zt\"l, and merited to receive from him guidance in avodas Hashem, the understanding of the human nefesh, and the foundations of man's purpose in this world.Throughout his life, from a young age until his passing on Purim 5773, Rav Hoffman assist- ed those who were in need of professional men- tal health counseling. Gedolei Yisrael (foremost among them Rav Shach zt\"l), Roshei Yeshiva, and school principals were greatly assisted by Rav Hoffman's advice and wisdom.In the last thirty years of his life, he agreed to the request of bnei Torah to give vaadim (private lectures) to small groups and individuals in matters of self-awareness, chinuch, and avodas Hashem. These vaadim were eventually organized and published under the title, Sichos im HaRav Shlomo Hoffman, the first volume in an upcoming series. The first half deals with anxiety over sin and failure. Rav Hoffman shows how to correct one's sins in a way that uplifts him and does not throw him into despair and misery. The second half deals with self-awareness of the kochos ha'nefesh.The responses received from across the Jewish world were phenomenal. Parents and educators, young and old, Torah scholars and laymen, mental health professionals and counselors - all enjoyed the unique depth of wisdom that Rav Shlomo had to share. Many commented that the sefer changed their outlook on life. It gave them new tools for education and for understanding the kochos ha'nefesh of their children and students.Now the English-speaking public can also be part of the amazing influence this sefer has had across the Torah world.

Why do we eat a full meal right in the middle of reciting Hallel? What is the meaning of the word\"Charoses\"? How many sacrifices did the kohanim slaughter per minute during the bringing of the korban Pesach? What was the weather like during Krias Yam Suf? Pesach heralds a time of preparation - cleaning, scrubbing and cooking. Yet of greater importance is the spiritual preparation for the holiday, and the pivotal Seder night. For it is this holiday that establishes the core of our relationship with G-d. By bringing us out of Egypt and punishing the nation that had enslaved us, G-d demonstrated that we are His chosen children.Every father is obligated to teach this to his children, to impart these basics of our faith on the night of the Seder.\"You shall relate in the ears of your child... that I made a mockery of Egypt and My miraculous signs that I placed among them, and you shall know that I am Hashem\" (Shemos 10:2). It is our obligation to teach our children the lessons learned from the Egyptians' punishments. Not only that Hashem punishes the wicked who mistreat His people - through the ten plagues, G-d demonstrated His dominion and sole control over the entire world.This book is designed to prepare the reader for this vital task. Step by step, it will take you through the Seder night, elaborate on the ten makkos, describe the suffering of our ancestors in Egypt, and rejoice in their ultimate redemption at the splitting of the sea. Complete with pictures that bring each part of the Seder to life, and a fascinating account of the bringing of the korban Pesach, it is the ultimate spiritual preparation for the Seder.\n\n\n\nSku:\nIBS-L275\n\n\nAuthor:\nRabbi Dovid Meisels\n\n\nIsbn 10:\n193168166X\n\n\nIsbn 13:\n9781931681667\n\n\nSize:\n6\" x 9\"\n\n\nBinding:\nHardcover\n\n\nImprint:\nIsrael Bookshop Publications\n\n\n", "option1": "Default Title", "option2": null, "option3": null, "sku": "IBS-L275", "requires_shipping": true, "taxable": true, "image": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0093/3625/8657/products/IBS-L275.jpg?v=1635959341", "available": true, "price": "23.49", "grams": 652, "compare_at_price": "25.99", "position": 1}, {"id": 42921437331655, "parent_id": 7568004939975, "handle": "tp-877-1", "vendor": "Riva Pomerantz", "tags": ["Author_Riva Pomerantz", "Categories_Novels", "Novels"], "options": [{"name": "Title", "position": 1, "values": ["Default Title"]}], "title": "See You - A Novel", "body_html": "\nPerfect.\nIt was more than a word.

In this adaptation, we study the Haggadah as the Alshich understood it. Utilizing his unique method of asking stimulating questions on which he focuses his commentary, the Alshich combines the classic teachings of the Sages with his own insights and often presents a truly original approach to the questions posed. \n \n \n \n Questions such as: how can we integrate the hidden message of the order of the Seder into our daily living? Why does the Seder experience begin with an invitation to strangers to join us at our meal? What is the thread that connects all the questions of the Four Sons? Why does the Haggadah place such emphasis on Rabbi Yehudah's three - word acronym of the Ten Plagues? These are a small sample of the queries and comments addressed in this fascinating commentary. \n \n \n \n More works have been written on the Haggadah than almost any other book in Torah literature - and rightly so. Every Seder is enriched by the presence of commentary after commentary, insight after insight, interpretation after interpretation. With the publication of this edition, English readers who have difficulty with scholarly Hebrew commentaries can see for themselves why the Alshich is considered one of the greatest of Torah expositors and why his commentary ranks amongst the seventy authentic ways to understand Torah. The Alshich's multi - faceted commentary provides thought - provoking questions and comments, together with novel insights and answers, in ample measure.\n \n \n \nWho was the Alshich?\n \n Rabbi Moshe Alshich (1508 - 1600), reverently referred to as HaAlshich HaKadosh (the Holy Alshich), was a dayan on the Tzefas Beis Din (Rabbinical Court) of Rabbi Yosef Caro, author of the Shulchan Aruch. He was also an early mentor of the Kabbalist Rabbi Chaim Vital. Although the Alshich wrote many halachic responsa, he is most noted for his Tanach commentary, based primarily on his regular Shabbos sermons. This monumental work has been hailed by more than four centuries of Torah scholars as one of the greatest expositions ever written on Scripture. In it, he expounds on complicated passages, answering fundamental questions of faith and Jewish belief. The Alshich uses his creative insight and his encyclopedic knowledge of Tanach, Talmud and Midrash to weave together his profound interpretations of Tanach. Studying Torah, Nevi'im and Kesuvim, by the bright light of the Alshich's commentary will warm the heart and illuminate the mind of every reader, from the nascent newcomer to the advanced talmid chacham. No less a personage than the Arizal, who would attend the Alshich's Shabbos derashos, described the Alshich's commentary as possessing?????????????????????????????????, one of just seventy authentic ways to understand Torah a rare accolade indeed.\n \n \n \nFrom the Approbations\n \n Rabbi Avie Gold has masterfully selected and translated the Alshich's illuminating interpretations and deep insights of the verses in the Torah that refer to yetzias Mitzrayim and the Seder night. These have been written in a lucid, pleasing English and will undoubtedly augment and enhance the readers' concept and understanding of the Haggadah, thus enriching the Seder and Pesach experience overall. \n \n -Dayan Menachem Gelley, Rosh London Beis Din / Rav of Beis Hamedrash Ohr Chodosh\n \n \n \n Studying the Haggadah as interpreted by the Alshich will shed new light on its lessons, and will illustrate how the holy words of Chazal have their foundations in the verses of Tanach, and will reveal the depth, beauty, and power of our traditions...This will undoubtedly enhance the English readers' understanding of the miracles of the Exodus... \n \n -Rav Shmuel Kamenetsky Rosh Yeshiva, Talmudical Yeshiva of Philadelphia\n \n \n \n This work will be a vital aid to those to whom the Hebrew text is not an option. It will also aid those who can read the original, but to whom English is not their mother tongue, and it will help clarify and make the words of the Alshich even more alive and understandable.\n \n -Rabbi Zev Leff, Rav of Moshav Matityahu\n \n \n \n Rabbi Avie Gold has skillfully translated and presented the commentary of Rabbi Alshich to our English - speaking generation in this book. He has done so with faithfulness to the text and clarity and insight in its translation. This Haggadah is therefore worthy of being on one's Seder table, and its profound insights should provide for great discussion and intellectual stimulation on the holy night of Pesach.\n \n -Rabbi Berel Wein, Historian, author, and international lecturer\n\n\n\nSku:\nF-084-7\n\n\nAuthor:\nAvie Gold\n\n\nIsbn 10:\n1598260847\n\n\nIsbn 13:\n9781598260847\n\n\nPages:\n320\n\n\nSize:\n6' x 9\"\n\n\nBinding:\nHardcover\n\n\nImprint:\nFeldheim Publishers\n\n\n", "option1": "Default Title", "option2": null, "option3": null, "sku": "F-084-7", "requires_shipping": true, "taxable": true, "image": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0093/3625/8657/products/F-084-7.jpg?v=1635955522", "available": true, "price": "17.99", "grams": 664, "compare_at_price": "19.99", "position": 1}, {"id": 41946167738567, "parent_id": 7286219571399, "handle": "att-bke-taojl", "vendor": "Rabbi Edward Reichman, MD", "tags": ["Author_Rabbi Edward Reichman MD", "Categories_General Halacha", "Categories_Jewish Law", "General Halacha", "Jewish Law"], "options": [{"name": "Title", "position": 1, "values": ["Default Title"]}], "title": "The Anatomy of Jewish Law", "body_html": "\n\nA Fresh Dissection of the RelationshipBetween Medicine, Medical History,& Rabbinic LiteratureWith a Foreword by Rabbi Dr. Avraham Steinberg \n\nIn this novel and innovative work, Edward Reichman traces the medical understanding of anatomy, physiology, and therapeutics across time and genres of rabbinic literature. The accumulated literature of centuries of Jewish legal discourse on medical topics serves as the foundation for contemporary Jewish bioethics. As these writings span the chronological gamut of scientific and medical discovery, it is essential to view each source in its proper historical context. Marshalling a vast array of sources from multiple disciplines, Reichman demonstrates the importance of the historical dimension not only for medical halakhic research, but to better understand the unique relationship of Judaism and medicine throughout the centuries.\"In his classic and vibrant style, Rabbi Dr. Edward Reichman has produced a masterpiece, integrating sources of halakha and medical history with the most recent medical advances. It is evident that Dr. Reichman's years of intensive research are now followed by his superb presentation of complex yet clear explanations of medical topics. The work is profusely annotated throughout with a multitude of halakhic, medical, and historical references. His scholarly and comprehensive discussions will prove invaluable to rabbis, physicians, and medical historians, as well as anyone wishing to gain an appreciation of the continuing achievements in the synthesis of halakha and modern medicine.\"PROFESSOR FRED ROSNER, MDWorld-renowned expert in Jewish medical ethicsand Jewish medical history, author of numerous books,including Biomedical Ethics and Jewish Law\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSku:\nATT-BKE-TAOJL\n\n\nAuthor:\nRabbi Edward Reichman, MD\n\n\nIsbn 13:\n9781592645794\n\n\nIsbn 10:\n1592645798\n\n\nPages:\n594\n\n\nSize:\n5.7\" x 8.7\"\n\n\nBinding:\nHardcover\n\n\nDate:\n2/16/2022\n\n\nImprint:\nMaggid\n\n\n", "option1": "Default Title", "option2": null, "option3": null, "sku": "ATT-BKE-TAOJL", "requires_shipping": true, "taxable": true, "image": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0093/3625/8657/products/ATT-BKE-TAOJL.jpg?v=1646878455", "available": true, "price": "32.99", "grams": 816, "compare_at_price": "34.95", "position": 1}, {"id": 43273133293767, "parent_id": 7708364603591, "handle": "f-8410", "vendor": "Rony Dayan", "tags": ["Author_Rony Dayan", "Categories_Self Help", "Self Help"], "options": [{"name": "Title", "position": 1, "values": ["Default Title"]}], "title": "The Architect", "body_html": "\nA Step By Step Guide To Self-Building\nHave you ever thought of becoming an architect?Even if you've never dreamed of sketching a blueprint or even building asimple house, this book is meant for you.Yes, for you - for every man or woman who aspires to build their bestself, a personality structured on a solid foundation, and to take good careof its maintenance.

The Chafetz Chaim was known for his stories and parables, which pepper his sefarim and his many discourses, making penetrating lessons easier for anyone to understand.Rav Chaim Ozer Grodzensky, zt\"l, said that the stories and parables of the Chafetz Chaim are like the mann that fell in the desert for Bnei Yisrael: just as every individual Jew was able to decide what his portion of mann should taste like, every individual today-man or woman, the very young or the aged- is able to glean an insight from the Chafetz Chaim's parables on his own level. A child appreciates a mashal because he enjoys a good story, and the talmid chacham appreciates the same mashal for the deep, penetrating lesson it imparts.This was one of the Chafetz Chaim's legacies to us: dozens of sefarim and discourses, in which he included hundreds of stories and parables to help us understand his teachings at our individual level.In his hesped for the Chafetz Chaim, Rav Moshe Landinsky, zt\"l, the rosh yeshivah of Yeshivas Radin, pointed out how the train engine pulls a string of train cars behind it with great force. If the engine would suddenly be disconnected from the rest of the cars, they would continue moving simply by momentum. But how long will they continue moving without the engine there to pull them?The parables, stories, and teachings in The Chafetz Chaim Haggadah are meant to draw out the force of momentum a little longer. To shine a brilliant light on the darkness of our times and enlighten us with the insights and lessons the Chafetz Chaim left behind for us.We may not be able to fathom his level-but we can get an understanding of his teachings through his parables and stories. The Chafetz Chaim's own words and lessons come to life in these pages, giving us a glimpse of a gadol b'Yisrael from a generation past.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSku:\nIBS-L847\n\n\nAuthor:\nRabbi Shalom Meir Wallach\n\n\nIsbn 10:\n1600915094\n\n\nIsbn 13:\n9781600915093\n\n\nPages:\n528\n\n\nSize:\n6.5\" x 9.5\"\n\n\nBinding:\nHardcover\n\n\nImprint:\nIsrael Bookshop Publications\n\n\n", "option1": "Default Title", "option2": null, "option3": null, "sku": "IBS-L847", "requires_shipping": true, "taxable": true, "image": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0093/3625/8657/products/IBS-L847.jpg?v=1635960040", "available": true, "price": "30.95", "grams": 1077, "compare_at_price": "30.95", "position": 1}, {"id": 40346726039751, "parent_id": 6829378666695, "handle": "hchash", "vendor": "Yisroel Besser", "tags": ["Author_Yisroel Besser", "Categories_Hebrew-English", "Hebrew-English", "Holiday", "Pesach"], "options": [{"name": "Title", "position": 1, "values": ["Default Title"]}], "title": "The Chasam Sofer Haggadah", "body_html": "\nThe Torah and Customs, Stories and Spirit ofRabbi Moshe Sofer of PressburgCapture his feelings of emunah and anticipation.Share his excitement and love for mitzvos.Feel his spirit at your Seder.\nOne of the greatest Torah sages of the 18th century, Rav Moshe Sofer, the Chasam Sofer, was a brilliant, compassionate, and fearless leader of Klal Yisrael.

As he turns to go, he is upset to see that he hasn't even made a dent in the treasure. But he has no choice. He can't carry any more.With this parable, Rav Akiva Eiger, zt\"l, the Chasam Sofer's renowned father-in-law, explains the pasuk \"I rejoice over Your word as one who finds great spoils\" (Tehillim 119:162). We can apply the same message to his sonin- law's teachings. Whatever Torah we might glean from them, it's but a drop in the ocean, a small dent in the immense treasure of knowledge that the Chasam Sofer possessed.The Chasam Sofer, rav and rosh yeshivah of Pressberg, was renowned for his brilliance. His knowledge encompassed every area of the Torah: both Halacha and aggadah, both the revealed and the hidden. He also taught thousands of talmidim, many of whom became great talmidei chachamim and leaders of Klal Yisrael in their own right.And he was an exemplary leader whose influence was widespread. As Rav Akiva Eiger told his daughter, \"The king may rule over this land, but your hUSBand rules over the entire world: people from every corner of the globe look to him for psak Halacha!\" The Chasam Sofer received and answered questions, not only from Poland, Russia, and Eretz Yisrael, but even countries in the East turned to him with their shailos.\nThe Chasam Sofer Pesach Haggadah was compiled from stories, meshalim, and divrei Torah from his many sefarim, from the sefarim of his talmidim, and from a selection of biographies. They provide a picture of a gadol who was both brilliant in his scholarship and a great leader of Klal Yisrael, fighting to preserve the fabric of the Torah way of life during the so-called Age of Enlightenment.Enhance your Seder table with teachings and stories about the Chasam Sofer and his talmidim.

Rather than losing heart, they should regard their setback as part of their service to Hashem and their spiritual growth, and not as a failure.\" From Chapter 4 of The Garden of Yearning With Hashem's loving grace, Yeshivat Chut Shel Chessed and Emuna Outreach are pleased to introduce \"The Garden of Yearning\" by Rav Shalom Arush translated into English. The book is now available here at the Beams. \"The Garden of Yearning\" is Rav Shalom's interpretation of Rebbe Nachman's \"Tale of the Lost Princess, \" which is loaded with Rebbe Nachman's powerful allusions that teach us the right road to emuna and to perfecting our souls. In effect, \"The Garden of Yearning\" is a sequel to \"The Garden of Emuna\", which is becoming an international hit having sold already more than 100,000 copies in Hebrew, English, and now Russian and French. Rav Shalom says that the most urgent item - in fact, the only item - on our agenda is spreading emuna as far, wide, and as fast as possible. With Hashem's blessing, that's exactly what we're trying to do. This is Rav Shalom Arush's amazing interpretation of Rebbe Nachman's \"Tale of the Lost Princess, \" revealing Rebbe Nachman's allusions to the proper service of Hashem. This book is a high-level sequel to The Garden of Emuna, for those who seriously seek more spirituality in their lives.

They are eager to fulfill the Biblical command to be fruitful and multiply, and concened to start the life of a child in an auspicious manner leading to a lifetime of Torah observance and mitzvos. Amid all the excitement they are surprised by the innumerable questions arising for the first time in their lives. Some of these relate directly to the birth of a child Can I drive to the hospital just before the end of Shabbos if the baby will be born after Shabbos? Is induction of labor sanctioned by Halacha? Can we name our son before his bris, if the bris will be delayed for a long time? The obstetrician suggests performing amniocentesis to check for birth defects, does Halacha sanction this? Other questions arise incidentally May a non-jew take me in the hospital elevator on Rosh Hashanah in order to hear shofar? Can I make kiddush even if I can only drink a small quantity of wine or grape juice? Can I daven while I have a catheter attached? The Halachos of Pregnancy and Childbirth is not just a book for the layman and woman, but also for the rabbi and the scholar. The erudition of its distinguished author is evident throughout the hundreds of detailed explanatory notes. Thein depth presentations of major halachic questions in the kovetz habiurim at the end of the book are halachic masterpieces, and have earned the enthusiastic approbations of great Poskim in the U.S. and in Eretz Yisroel.

Another package from home. Another sumptuous cheesecake ...Suddenly he saw it. A silver Mitsubishi Lancer. Abba's car.He flew breathlessly down the stairs and raced toward the car-but then he saw that a different bachur had preceded him. A bachur he didn't even know by name. The bachur leaned through the open window and smiled at the driver, a man with a long black beard who looked nothing like Abba. A minute later, he sauntered inside holding a beautifully decorated cheese log.Meir turned on his heel and trudged back to his room, still trying to catch his breath. How had he been taken by such a foolish fantasy? For six months already, Abba's been in a place where he can\u2019t drive or buy cheesecake. It's been six months since Meir had become an orphan.The beis midrash, he knew, was now packed with bachurim with glowing faces. They'd all received dairy delicacies in honor of Shavuos. They all had someone at home who'd thought of them-who had either baked or purchased a cheesecake especially for them, and then taken the trouble to deliver it to yeshivah. Someone cared about them. And him?He was an orphan.The fifteen protagonists in this book are fifteen incredible people who internalized that no matter the situation HaKadosh Baruch Hu places us in, we are obligated to bow our heads and accept it: This is the situation.

How can we achieve anemuna that is integrated, consistent with our rational context, yet still retains its Near Eastern soul?Award - winning author Rabbi Jeremy Kagan here presents us with keen and powerful insights into the nature ofemuna in the modern world. He shows how the experience of the Exodus from Egypt was structured to teach us to engage reality in a manner that sensitizes the various facets of our character to see creation reflected in the world around us - to become conscious of God through our perception of reality.

The old guard-socialist secular elites and idealists-are a dying breed, and the state's democratic foundations are being challenged. A dynamic and exuberant country of nine million, Israel is now largely comprised of native-born Hebrew speakers, and yet any permanent sense of security and normalcy is elusive.In The Land of Hope and Fear, we meet Israelis: Jews and Arabs, religious and secular, Eastern and Western, liberals and zealots-plagued by perennial conflict and existential threats, citizens who remain deeply polarized politically, socially, and ideologically, even as they undergo generational change and redefine what it is to be an Israeli. Who are these people and to what do they aspire?In moving narratives and with on-the-ground reporting, Isabel Kershner reveals the core of what holds Israel together and the forces that threaten its future through the lens of real people: a son of Zionist pioneers, cynical about what is to come and his people's status in it; a woman in her nineties whose life in a kibbutz has disintegrated; a brilliant poet caught up in the political maelstrom; an Arab gallery owner archiving a lost Palestinian landscape; and a descendant of the Russian aliyah; representing millions of culturally and religiously different Jews, laying bare the question Who is an Israeli? The Land of Hope and Fear decodes Israel today at its seventy-fifth anniversary, examining the ways in which the country has both exceeded and failed the ideals and expectations of its founders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSku:\nCIS-676-3\n\n\nAuthor:\nIsabel Kershner\n\n\nIsbn 13:\n9781101946763\n\n\nIsbn 10:\n1101946768\n\n\nPages:\n370\n\n\nSize:\n6.5\" x 9.5\"\n\n\nBinding:\nHardcover\n\n\nDate:\n5/16/2023\n\n\nImprint:\nKnopf\n\n\n", "option1": "Default Title", "option2": null, "option3": null, "sku": "CIS-676-3", "requires_shipping": true, "taxable": true, "image": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0093/3625/8657/products/CIS-676-3.jpg?v=1690990271", "available": true, "price": "27.99", "grams": 680, "compare_at_price": "30.00", "position": 1}, {"id": 43791767765191, "parent_id": 7913959719111, "handle": "ibs-la398", "vendor": "Yonah Klein", "tags": ["Author_Yonah Klein", "Categories_Novels", "Novels"], "options": [{"name": "Title", "position": 1, "values": ["Default Title"]}], "title": "The Last Rebbe of Lodz - A Novel", "body_html": "Everyone in Lodz knew the Rebbe, Reb Menashe Sholom Ginzburg,scion of the great dynasty of Lodzer chassidus.

It is at this sorrowful time that we find ourselves clinging more than ever to the Torah, and specifically to the laws and customs of mourning.

For laymen, and especially for those who need a quick and definitive answer to their questions, this beautifully structured book takes the mourner from moments before the death of a loved one, through aninus, the funeral, the various stages of mourning, Kaddish, and up through the first yahrzeit. The concepts related to the Halacha are clearly defined, and the Halacha is presented concisely, so the reader immediately knows what to do. For those who want to study further, Hebrew footnotes show sources and discuss other opinions, and a detailed index makes it easy to find specific topics and questions.\n \n Does a person who'd been an onen have to make up the tefillos he missed, when the levayah is over?

A man of singularbrilliance, he was highly respected by the Torah leaders of his time.Yet he was also a charismatic teacher and a father figure to so many tough,undisciplined, alienated Jewish youths. A pioneer in kiruv rechokim longbefore kiruv was popular, he lovingly guided them to Torah and yirasShamayim, maintaining a close connection with them as they went on tobuild Torah-true lives.With extraordinary dedication and determination, this unassuming manovercame incredible obstacles to achieve what most people would haveconsidered to be unattainable goals. He revived Breslov Chassidus inAmerica, building it into a vibrant force where it had previously been allbut unknown.Rabbi Rosenfeld succeeded in visiting Uman numerous times, togetherwith groups of his talmidim.

Yet there is so much more depth and meaning to the holiday, so many rich and inspiring lessons it has to elevate our lives. And though Tu B'Shvat is often almost overlooked, or simply marked by a few moments of eating dried fruit, it, too, is a day of profound spiritual awakening and significance.The unexplored depths of Chanukah and Tu B'Shvat beckon the thoughtful and perceptive Jew to discover the treasures that lie beneath the surface. In this collection of wide-ranging, stimulating, and original essays, Rabbi Daniel Glatstein draws upon a vast array of sources, many of them rare and some almost unknown, to show us the deep inner dimensions of these two holidays, and how they relate to contemporary times.What makes the mitzvah of Chanukah candles \"beloved to Hashem\" - and why is the mitzvah so hard to fulfill properly? Why did we need the miracle of the oil at all... and what does it tell us about our own daily lives? Why was the miracle of Chanukah not recorded in Tanach? What is the connection between Tu B'Shvat and repentance - and what is the difference between the teshuvah of Rosh Hashanah and that of Tu B'Shvat?Rav and founder of Machon Maggid Harakiah in Cedarhurst, New York, Rabbi Glatstein is one of the contemporary Jewish world's most popular speakers and respected maggidei shiur. As you read these brilliant and illuminating essays, you will understand why his more than 5,000 shiurim have garnered literally millions of views and downloads on Torahanytime.com and other venues, while his Hebrew-language sefarim, too, have been acclaimed throughout the Torah world.Like the glowing flames of the Menorah, The Light and the Splendor brings us a luminous new understanding of Chanukah and Tu B'Shvat, an important contribution to Torah literature and a precious gift to us all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSku:\nLSPLH\n\n\nAuthor:\nRabbi Daniel Glatstein\n\n\nIsbn 10:\n1422627535\n\n\nIsbn 13:\n9781422627532\n\n\nPages:\n422\n\n\nSize:\n6.3\" x 9.3\"\n\n\nBinding:\nHardcover\n\n\nDate:\n11/18/2020\n\n\nImprint:\nArtscroll Mesorah Publications\n\n\n", "option1": "Default Title", "option2": null, "option3": null, "sku": "LSPLH", "requires_shipping": true, "taxable": true, "image": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0093/3625/8657/products/753-5_acfe9c51-1ec3-45e2-8156-c5c34ea1f64e.jpg?v=1635963101", "available": true, "price": "25.99", "grams": 862, "compare_at_price": "29.99", "position": 1}, {"id": 31941567774817, "parent_id": 4543615991905, "handle": "18909037", "vendor": "Rabbi Moshe Shuchatowitz", "tags": ["Author_Rabbi Moshe Shuchatowitz", "Categories_Dating & Marriage", "Dating & Marriage"], "options": [{"name": "Title", "position": 1, "values": ["Default Title"]}], "title": "The Living Marriage", "body_html": "\nA Journey Into The Heart of Marriage\nThe Living Marriage is a translation and upgraded version of the Hebrew Book, Binyan HaBayis, which has helped tens of thousands of couples enhance their marriage over the past two decades.

Whether or not there is any credence to that story, the fame and impact of the Maharal on his own generation and on all future generations surely rests on a more solid foundation. The Maharal of Prague was a towering giant in Torah and Kabbalah and a fearless leader of European Jewry during the sixteenth century. His seminal works have served as guideposts on the highways of Jewish thought for hundreds of years. In communal affairs, the Maharal guided the affairs of some of the most prominent Jewish communities in Central Europe, sometimes in an official rabbinic capacity, sometimes as a private citizen. His company and advice were sought by kings and noblemen, giving rise to many colorful legends, some of which appear in the pages of this book. \"The Maharal of Prague: The Story of Rabbi Yehudah Loew\" is a compelling portrait of this great spiritual figure whose immortal works dominate Jewish thought to this very day. Most of the material is derived from reliable sources, and the few unsubstantiated legends included are clearly defined as such for the benefit of the reader. Vivid images of the Jewish communities and life styles of sixteenth century Europe emerge from Yaakov Dovid Shulman's lively and descriptive prose, providing a fascinating setting for the life and works of the legendary Maharal of Prague.\n\n\n\nSku:\nCIS-168-0\n\n\nAuthor:\nYaacov Dovid Shulman\n\n\nIsbn 10:\n1560621680\n\n\nIsbn 13:\n9781560621683\n\n\nPages:\n237\n\n\nSize:\n6\" x 9\"\n\n\nBinding:\nHardcover\n\n\nImprint:\nCIS Publisers\n\n\n", "option1": "Default Title", "option2": null, "option3": null, "sku": "CIS-168-0", "requires_shipping": true, "taxable": true, "image": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0093/3625/8657/products/CIS-168-0.jpg?v=1635954553", "available": true, "price": "19.99", "grams": 408, "compare_at_price": "23.95", "position": 1}, {"id": 43640519262407, "parent_id": 7859477643463, "handle": "f-8501", "vendor": "Donny Frank", "tags": ["Author_Donny Frank", "Categories_Dating & Marriage", "Dating & Marriage"], "options": [{"name": "Title", "position": 1, "values": ["Default Title"]}], "title": "The Making of A Dynamic Duo", "body_html": "\nA Couple's Guide To Connection\nIncludes A Communication Handbook\nFrom newlyweds to seasoned couplesYou \"2\" Can Become A Dynamic Duo!\n\"Wise, practical, down-to-earth...

He was a Rebbe and Rosh Yeshivah. A leader of the worldwide Torah community. A brilliant thinker, gifted speaker and writer, a compassionate guide and advisor to thousands, and, of course, an outstanding talmid chacham.We all know the story of the Exodus, of Yetziyas Mitzrayim. In The Novominsk Haggadah Rav Perlow reveals to us the neshamah, the soul of that story. He examines each word of the Haggadah and creates a brilliant synthesis of machshavah and hashkafah, of Midrashim and commentaries. He shares with us a breathtaking view of the mission and miracle of the Jewish People, and gives us a new and powerful appreciation of what we are celebrating as we sit down to our Seder.Here are so many important themes, so many eye-opening insights. What does it mean to be the Chosen People? What are the foundations of our emunah? How can we understand Hashem's unalterable love for Klal Yisrael? What are the lessons of history that we can learn, and how do they pertain to our lives today? What does our past tell us about our future?\nThe Novominsk Haggadah also includes a special section on the Rebbe's teachings of Shir HaShirim, which gives us a new and intriguing understanding of its words.\nRabbi Yecheskel Ostreicher was a close talmid of Rav Perlow. Working together with members of the Novominsker's family and many of his students, he has drawn upon the Rebbe's shiurim, speeches and writings to fashion a Haggadah that will enrich our Seder, and our lives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSku:\nHNOVH\n\n\nAuthor:\nRabbi Yaakov Perlow\n\n\nIsbn 10:\n1422627985\n\n\nIsbn 13:\n9781422627983\n\n\nPages:\n388\n\n\nSize:\n6.3\" x 9.3\"\n\n\nBinding:\nHardcover\n\n\nDate:\n2/24/2021\n\n\nImprint:\nArtscroll Mesorah Publications\n\n\n", "option1": "Default Title", "option2": null, "option3": null, "sku": "HNOVH", "requires_shipping": true, "taxable": true, "image": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0093/3625/8657/products/798-5_9dc355bf-6250-42bc-8d0d-d86f2b583c8a.jpg?v=1635959098", "available": true, "price": "23.99", "grams": 862, "compare_at_price": "27.99", "position": 1}, {"id": 31941735383137, "parent_id": 4543697125473, "handle": "f-205-5", "vendor": "Rabbi A.

In a car whose gas tank is on fire, in a tunnel dug by terrorists with murder in their hearts and weapons in their hands, even in an American army unit in the First World War that recited Psalm 91 every single day - and did not suffer even one combat-related death - in historic events and everyday happenings, we see the fulfillment of the immortal words of Yosheiv BeSeiser.This beautiful work opens our eyes and we see Hashem's protective Arms around us, a Father shielding His children - and we are no longer afraid.\nWatch the Inside Artscroll interview with the author, R' Yechiel Spero\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSku:\nPRAYH\n\n\nAuthor:\nRabbi Yechiel Spero\n\n\nIsbn 10:\n1422628256\n\n\nIsbn 13:\n9781422628256\n\n\nPages:\n123\n\n\nSize:\n6.3\" x 9.3\"\n\n\nBinding:\nHardcover\n\n\nDate:\n4/19/2021\n\n\nImprint:\nArtscroll Mesorah Publications\n\n\n", "option1": "Default Title", "option2": null, "option3": null, "sku": "PRAYH", "requires_shipping": true, "taxable": true, "image": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0093/3625/8657/products/825-6_0dd521b5-df34-43c5-b9e4-c11276de313b.jpg?v=1635964182", "available": true, "price": "19.99", "grams": 363, "compare_at_price": "21.99", "position": 1}, {"id": 42700923568327, "parent_id": 7482693288135, "handle": "5657017", "vendor": "HaRav Dovid Goldwasser", "tags": ["Author_HaRav Dovid Goldwasser", "Bible Commentaries", "Categories_Bible Commentaries", "Categories_Weekly Parshah", "Weekly Parshah"], "options": [{"name": "Title", "position": 1, "values": ["Default Title"]}], "title": "The Promise of The Zera Shimshon", "body_html": "Chiddushei Torah Of TheZera ShimshonOn Inyanei TeshuvahIncluding Soul-StirringStories And Insights\n\n\n\nSku:\n5657017\n\n\nAuthor:\nHaRav Dovid Goldwasser\n\n\nPages:\n184\n\n\nSize:\n6.7\" x 9.7\"\n\n\nBinding:\nHardcover\n\n\nDate:\n9/12/2022\n\n\n", "option1": "Default Title", "option2": null, "option3": null, "sku": "5657017", "requires_shipping": true, "taxable": true, "image": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0093/3625/8657/products/5657017.jpg?v=1663102479", "available": true, "price": "14.99", "grams": 544, "compare_at_price": "0.00", "position": 1}, {"id": 32679259865185, "parent_id": 4749146652769, "handle": "att-bke-tqwy", "vendor": "Rabbi Yaakov Hillel", "tags": ["Author_Rabbi Yaakov Hillel", "Categories_Dating & Marriage", "Categories_Women's Interest", "Dating & Marriage", "Women's Interest"], "options": [{"name": "Title", "position": 1, "values": ["Default Title"]}], "title": "The Queen Within You", "body_html": "\nIssues and Answers for Today's Eshet HayilThe G-d-given role of a Jewish wife and mother is a vehicle for ongoing personal growth and enormous satisfaction.

There's a villain out to hang Mordechai and murder his countrymen; a king who enjoys drinking; and a beautiful and noble queen. There are assassins, palace intrigue and a climactic battle scene - and a happy ending, to boot. What more could you ask for in a good child's story? The holiday associated with the book can seem child-like, too. Purim is celebrated with costumes, carnivals, and abundant merriment. Kids dress up as Esther, Mordechai, Haman and Achashveirosh, wearing plastic hats and cellophane scepters. Purim is the great holiday of make-believe. All this make believe, though, can have unintended consequences. Chief among them is the fact that many of us are likely to remain with childlike views of Purim and the Megillah long after we've turned adults. Our perspective upon Mordechai and Esther and their struggle can easily remain as one-dimensional as the face paint we use to impersonate these people in costume. In this book, Rabbi Fohrman invites the reader to look at the Book of Esther with fresh eyes; to join him, as it were, on a guided adventure - a close reading of the ancient biblical text. In so doing, he reveals another Purim story; a richer, deeper narrative more suited perhaps, to the eyes of an adult than to a child. As layers of meaning are gradually revealed, Esther's hidden story comes alive in a vibrant, unexpected way - offering the reader a fascinating and stirring encounter with the queen whose costume they wore as children - the queen they thought they knew.\n\n\n\nSku:\nHFBS-901-4\n\n\nAuthor:\nRabbi David Fohrman\n\n\nIsbn 10:\n0983269017\n\n\nIsbn 13:\n9780983269014\n\n\nPages:\n162\n\n\nSize:\n6.3\" x 9.3\"\n\n\nBinding:\nHardcover\n\n\nDate:\n3/1/2011\n\n\nImprint:\nHfbs Press\n\n\n", "option1": "Default Title", "option2": null, "option3": null, "sku": "HFBS-901-4", "requires_shipping": true, "taxable": true, "image": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0093/3625/8657/products/HFBS-901-4.jpg?v=1635959017", "available": true, "price": "22.99", "grams": 454, "compare_at_price": "24.95", "position": 1}, {"id": 42055963869383, "parent_id": 7311765766343, "handle": "ibs-la275", "vendor": "Israel Bookshop Publications", "tags": ["Categories_Hebrew-English", "Hebrew-English", "Holiday", "Pesach"], "options": [{"name": "Title", "position": 1, "values": ["Default Title"]}], "title": "The Questions Asked Haggadah (Revised and Expanded)", "body_html": "\nQuestions & AnswersTo Make Your SederCome Alive\nAccompanied by both Ashkenazic and Sephardic Nussachosand Their Individual Customs.The beautiful collection of divrei Torah in this Haggadah will:Explain the simple meaning of the words of the Haggadah.Create a deeper understanding and appreciation of the Pesach Seder.Help us to relive the miracles of Yetzias Mitzrayim.Emphasize emunah and hashgachas Hashem, with the goal ofbringing us closer to Him.Enable us to transmit our golden mesorah to our children.Written in conversational English, with clear instructions and translations,this is your perfect companion for the Seder night.

Rav Shimon Schwab was renowned for imparting generations of Jews with the foundational principles of emunah, bitachon, yiras Shamayim, emes and ehrlichkeit, as well as for his brilliant and novel Torah thoughts. His teachings reflect a sincerity and love of Hashem and His Torah that is infectious.The Rav Schwab Haggadah offers a wealth of insights into the basics of emunah, conveyed with great passion and emotion. Rav Schwab's style is clear, fresh, thought-provoking, and always inspiring. This volume is a compendium of commentaries and insights gleaned from the Rav's teachings in Maayan Beis Hashoeva, Rav Schwab on Prayer, and from shiurim, writings, and speeches, as well as from many never-before published kesavim (notes).Rav Schwab was a Rav for over 65 years in Germany, Baltimore, and New York, as well as a Rosh Beis Din, posek and mechanech par excellence. A product of Yeshiva Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch in Frankfurt, Germany, he also gained exposure to the great yeshivos of Eastern-Europe and their style of limud haTorah and mussar. He was a talmid of such pre-war legendary greats as Reb Leizer Yudel Finkel, Rav Yeruchem Levovitz, Rav Chaim Telzer and Rav Yosef Leib Bloch. The result was a magnificent synthesis of both glorious traditions.\nThe Rav Schwab Haggadah will enrich our Seder, our Pesach, and our lives.Includes a New, Expansive Commentary on Hallel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSku:\nHSOH\n\n\nAuthor:\nRabbi Shimon Schwab\n\n\nIsbn 10:\n1422623025\n\n\nIsbn 13:\n9781422623022\n\n\nPages:\n332\n\n\nSize:\n6.3\" x 9.3\"\n\n\nBinding:\nHardcover\n\n\nDate:\n3/19/2019\n\n\nImprint:\nArtscroll Mesorah Publications\n\n\n", "option1": "Default Title", "option2": null, "option3": null, "sku": "HSOH", "requires_shipping": true, "taxable": true, "image": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0093/3625/8657/products/302-5_5d106302-9e42-43f6-90da-8cebea9ad00d.jpg?v=1635959134", "available": true, "price": "24.99", "grams": 680, "compare_at_price": "28.99", "position": 1}, {"id": 40346739146951, "parent_id": 6829380174023, "handle": "hrmh", "vendor": "Rabbi Shalom Meir Wallach", "tags": ["Categories_Haggadahs", "Categories_Hebrew-English", "Haggadahs", "Hebrew-English", "Holiday", "Pesach"], "options": [{"name": "Title", "position": 1, "values": ["Default Title"]}], "title": "The Reb Moshe Haggadah", "body_html": "\nInvite Reb Moshe Feinstein zt\"l to your Seder table.\nThe Reb Moshe Haggadah beautifully captures the many facets of the gaon and posek hador: his brilliance in piskei Halacha and Gemara; his insights and deep understanding of Torah hashkafah; his incredible diligence and his extraordinary compassion.\nMuch of the commentary is taken from Reb Moshe's prolific writings on Halacha, Chumash, and Talmud.

Go to the Grand Rabbi on Beacon Street. He always has room for one more.\"He came from a long line of chassidic leaders, reaching all the way back to the Baal Shem Tov. He was the son of the first Bostoner Rebbe, Rabbi Pinchos Dovid Horowitz. He was a brilliant Torah scholar, having learned at Mesivta Torah Vodaath under one of the greatest roshei yeshivah of that time. And yet in his profound modesty, Rav Levi Yitzchok Horowitz did not see himself as a rebbe.Hashem, though, decreed otherwise. When a small group of his father's followers pleaded with Rav Levi Yitzchok to come to Boston and lead their shul, he acquiesced. And in the next sixty years, he and his devoted rebbetzin would change the lives of thousands. As rav of his kehillah - which included influential professionals and intellectuals - a dynamic leader of the Boston Jewish community, and Shabbos host to scores of searching college students, the Bostoner Rebbe was a pivotal figure in the flourishing of Torah life in America in the decades after World War II.In The Rebbe on Beacon Street you will read of the Rebbe's wisdom and warmth, of his burning desire to help every Jew who came his way, both physically and spiritually. Like Avraham Avinu and Sarah Imeinu, the Rebbe and Rebbetzin on Beacon Street opened their homes to all: everyone was welcomed and treated like family.Among the Rebbe's greatest achievements was his founding of ROFEH International, an organization dedicated to providing medical referrals and support services to sick people and their families.When already in his mid-60s - when many are beginning to contemplate retirement - the Rebbe founded a new community with the opening of a shul in Jerusalem's Har Nof neighborhood. For the next two decades, he would spend six months a year leading and developing a Bostoner kehillah in Eretz Yisrael, while continuing to be a father figure to his flock in Boston.Come and meet The Rebbe on Beacon Street. As you bask in the glow of his overflowing ahavas Yisrael, you will feel inspired. Enlightened.

So on Shabbos, this sefer will whisk you to theBais Yisroel shul on Ocean Parkway, and you too will be zocheh tohear the Rav's Shabbos\u00a0drashos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSku:\nBR-10342\n\n\nAuthor:\nRav Avigdor Miller\n\n\nIsbn 13:\n9781954350991\n\n\nIsbn 10:\n1954350996\n\n\nPages:\n510\n\n\nSize:\n6.3\" x 9.3\"\n\n\nBinding:\nHardcover\n\n\nDate:\n8/15/2023\n\n\nImprint:\nSimchas Hachaim Publishing\n\n\n", "option1": "Default Title", "option2": null, "option3": null, "sku": "BR-10342", "requires_shipping": true, "taxable": true, "image": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0093/3625/8657/products/BR-10342.jpg?v=1692128111", "available": true, "price": "27.99", "grams": 907, "compare_at_price": "0.00", "position": 1}, {"id": 41326119583943, "parent_id": 7111409631431, "handle": "ho2h", "vendor": "Rabbi Simcha Bunim Cohen", "tags": ["Author_Rabbi Simcha Bunim Cohen", "Categories_Jewish Law", "Categories_Shabbos", "Jewish Law", "Shabbos"], "options": [{"name": "Title", "position": 1, "values": ["Default Title"]}], "title": "The Shabbos Home Volume 2", "body_html": "\nA comprehensive halachic guide to the laws of shabbos as they apply throughout the homeA Compendium of Practical HalachahIt is Shabbos, your three-year-old has locked himself in the bedroom and cannot open the door.

With its clear, understandable explanations of the issues involved and extensive notes, tens of thousands turned to The Shabbos Kitchen to understand the often complex halachos of preparing food and other kitchen activities on Shabbos.With the passing of time and massive changes in technology, many new questions have been raised, many new piskei halachah have been developed. Raw fish, once considered inedible, now graces our sushi - has its status of muktzeh changed, as well? What issues are raised by modern-day water coolers, warming drawers, and digital features on refrigerators?The Shabbos Kitchen -- Fully Revised and Expanded\u00a0includes ten completely new chapters discussing halachos and scenarios not included in the earlier volume. In addition, as a world-class posek, Rabbi Cohen has heard countless shailos about Shabbos observance in these decades, and he has incorporated many of them into existing chapters. Indeed, one chapter with common applications is twice the size of the original, and two others, also pertaining to melachos that apply frequently, are three times the size!While many things have changed in these past decades, some things stay the same. Things like our devotion to Shabbos, and our desire to show our love for it by keeping its halachos properly.

Goldenshteyn (1848-1930), a traditional Jew who was or-phaned as a young boy, is a master storyteller. Folksy, funny, streetwise, andself-confident, he is a keen observer of nineteenth-century Eastern Europe.His accounts are vivid and readable, sometimes stunning in their intensity.The memoir is brimming with information; his adventures shed light oncommunal life, persecution, family relationships, religious practices andbeliefs, social classes, local politics, interactions between Jews and otherreligious communities (including Muslims, who formed the majority ofCrimea's populace), epidemics, poverty, competition for resources, migra-tion, war, modernity and secularization, holy men and charlatans, acts ofkindness and acts of treachery. In chronicling his own life, Goldenshteyninadvertently tells a bigger story - the story of how a small, oppressedpeople, among other minority groups, struggled for survival in the massiveRussian Empire.Until now, only a small circle of Yiddish-speaking scholars had accessto this extremely significant primary source. This translation is a game-changer, making this treasure trove of information accessible to academicsand ordinary readers alike. Informed by research in Ukrainian, Israeli, andAmerican archives and personal interviews with the few surviving indi-viduals who knew Goldenshteyn personally, The Shochet is a magnificentnew contribution to Jewish and Eastern European history.\nMichoel Rotenfeld is a historical researcher who haslong been fascinated by Jewish memory in its myriadforms, especially the genre of Jewish autobiography.

This is a city of beautiful simplicity, of impressivepoverty, of concealed genius, of righteousness and exaltedasceticism hidden within modest behavior, and of the sim-ple chesed that is done constantly in its courtyards and al-leys without anybody taking notice.Yerushalayim of pure gold is concealed under the roughsurface of people who sometimes seem cold and aloof, butwho burn with the fire of humanity and Yiddishkeit that canbe awakened by a pashkevil hanging on the ancient walls ofthe Yishuv Hayashan.\nAryeh Ehrlich, a prominent chareidi journalist who was born in Batei Ungarin,often tells the story of Yerushalayim to the outside world. Baruch Yaari is an accom-plished photographer who was allowed entry with his camera, for over fifteen years,into the most guarded places of the Yishuv Hayashan. Together, these two artistshave created this pictorial album that documents the alleys and shuls, the storesand workshop Erev Shabbos and yearly events, and the happy and sad moments inthe neighborhoods that are more a legendary concept than a mere residential area.The Soul of Yerushalayim documents the heart of Yerushalayim that continues toexist in the present with that same old spirit and authenticity. It takes the reader onan enchanting journey through the wondrous stones, alleys, yards, moments, andpeople of Yerushalayim shel Maalah.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSku:\nF-7983\n\n\nAuthor:\nBaruch Yaari & Aryeh Ehrlich\n\n\nTranslator:\nDinna Harris\n\n\nIsbn 13:\n9781680255164\n\n\nIsbn 10:\n1680255169\n\n\nPages:\n396\n\n\nSize:\n9\" x 9.7\"\n\n\nBinding:\nHardcover\n\n\nDate:\n2/22/2022\n\n\nImprint:\nFeldheim Publishers\n\n\n\n", "option1": "Default Title", "option2": null, "option3": null, "sku": "F-7983", "requires_shipping": true, "taxable": true, "image": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0093/3625/8657/products/F-7983.jpg?v=1645580899", "available": true, "price": "37.99", "grams": 1497, "compare_at_price": "39.99", "position": 1}, {"id": 40799430934727, "parent_id": 6830557102279, "handle": "sparh", "vendor": "Rabbi Yechiel Spero", "tags": ["Author_Rabbi Yechiel Spero", "Categories_Inspirational & Short Stories", "Inspirational & Short Stories"], "options": [{"name": "Title", "position": 1, "values": ["Default Title"]}], "title": "The Spark of A Story", "body_html": "Rabbi Yechiel Spero tells stories that ignite sparks within us!\n Sparks of faith.

Five wars tested Israel's ability to survive. Despite conflict and terror, Israel has sought peace through both secret and public negotiations, an effort which continues to this day. Through all of this, Israel remains a vibrant Jewish State and homeland. The Story of Israel brings the period to life through rare documents, photographs, maps and Martin Gilbert's illuminating text.\nSir Martin Gilbert (1936-2015), biographer of Winston Churchill and a leading historian on the twentieth century, wrote 25 books on aspects of Jewish history, including 10 books on Israel. He received honorary degrees from three Israeli universities and the prestigious Dan David Prize in 2012. In 1995 he was awarded a knighthood for services to British history and international relations.

If the leaders refuse, the entire ghetto will be liquidated. Terrified, they go to the ghetto's rabbi for advice; he tells them to return the next morning. Over the course of the night the rabbi calls up the spirits of legendary rabbis from centuries past for advice on what to do, but no one can give him a satisfactory answer. The eighteenth-century mystic and founder of Hasidism, the Baal Shem Tov, tries to intercede with God by singing a niggun-a wordless, joyful melody with the power to break the chains of evil.The next evening, when no volunteers step forward, the ghetto's residents are informed that in an hour they will all be killed. As the minutes tick by, the ghetto's rabbi teaches his assembled community the song that the Baal Shem Tov had sung the night before.

This book is dedicated l'ilui nishmas my dear mother, Mrs. Rachel Zlotowitz a\"h who passed away as the finishing touches were being placed into this work. The weekly Tidbits has, b\"h, been met with much acclaim. It all started a few years back following the passing of my father, Rav Meir Zlotowitz z\"l on Rosh Chodesh Tammuz 5777 (2017). Throughout my life, my father was a source for inspiration and guidance. When a question presented itself leaving me in doubt, whether regarding Yom Tov or on any other occasion, about our minhag or a halachah, I would turn to him for guidance. With his passing I felt a personal void, a void that led me to recognize that a publication with the relevant information for Jewish life can play a vital role. The Tidbits slowly evolved into the success it is today, providing Klal Yisrael with information they need regarding minhagim and halachos throughout the year. Many Tidbits are based on what I saw by my father z\"l who followed his family minhag along with guidance from his great Rabbeim, Harav Moshe Feinstein zt\"l and Harav David Feinstein zt\"l. Each person should certainly follow their own traditions and the guidance they receive from their Rabbanim, while using this guidebook as a point of reference.Over the course of life, one has the opportunity to attend simchos and bez\"h to make simchos as well. The Tidbits on the Lifecycle series, included in this work, was created with the baal simchah and their guests in mind, so that they can know and understand the events they are celebrating.A source for guidance, reminders and Torah knowledge, the Tidbits has the zechus of providing for a broad audience spanning the entire spectrum of Klal Yisrael. The Tidbits is distributed in print to close to 500 Shuls and tens of thousands of homes. Thousands of subscribers receive the digital distribution, via email and WhatsApp. demonstrating the thirst that Jews have to be connected to Torah and yiddishkeit. We thank ArtScroll/Mesorah Publications for their assistance in distributing the weekly edition.This publication can be used for any year and contains all the information and Torah which is enjoyed each week. The reminder section herein contains information specific to the period of Kislev 5783 thru Adar 5784.

The Nazi net closed slowly around the Jews of Poland, impoverishing them, demoralizing them, enslaving them, isolating them in ghettos and finally herding them into concentration camps. Million of Polish Jews were caught in the monstrous Nazi trap, while thousands more fled into hiding in the cities and the countryside. For the desperate fugitives life was always a continuous nightmare, with agonizing days and terror-filled nights, never knowing if the next day would bring starvation or discovery. \"They Called Me Frau Anna\" is the breathtaking account of one valiant Jewish woman and her struggle to save her two small children in the midst of the blazing inferno that was consuming her family and her people. With false identification papers, she wanders from town to town seeking shelter and food for herself and children, always in fear of discovery and betrayal. In episode after hair-rising episode, guided by an unmistakable hashgachah pratis, she manages to elude capture, only to find herself back on the street in search of a new hiding place. Finally, she finds refuge in Krakow as a housekeeper for Dr. Helmut Sopp, a high-ranking Nazi official who is eventually imprisoned as a war criminal. After earning the respect of Sopp ands his wife Toni, she is allowed to bring her children to stay with her, but her harrowing experiences continues, taking a new dimension as she must constantly deflect the suspicions of the numerous Nazis she comes into contact with in the course of her duties. Through all her tragedy and heartbreak, she finds in herself deep reservoirs of faith and fortitude that help her keep alive a tiny spark of hope and sanity in her darkest hours. \"They Called Me Frau Anna\" is the second volume in \"The Holocaust Diaries, \" of which the highly acclaimed \"Late Shadows\" was the inaugural volume. In keeping with the theme of the collection, it is the personal statement of the survivor in whom the holocaust brought out profound spiritual qualities, who emerged from this terrible crucible victorious rather than crushed and defeated. All in all, it is a book permeated by the noble spirit of the author and the indomitable faith that helped her rise above the horrors of her experiences and emerge stronger and more inspired than ever before\n\n\n\nSku:\nCIS-029-3\n\n\nAuthor:\nChana Marcus Banet\n\n\nIsbn 10:\n1560620293\n\n\nIsbn 13:\n9781560620297\n\n\nPages:\n331\n\n\nSize:\n6.3\" x 9.3\"\n\n\nBinding:\nHardcover\n\n\nDate:\n1/1/1991\n\n\nImprint:\nCIS Publisers\n\n\n", "option1": "Default Title", "option2": null, "option3": null, "sku": "CIS-029-3", "requires_shipping": true, "taxable": true, "image": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0093/3625/8657/products/CIS-029-3_14064bd6-06a4-4a04-8c26-3e721c06850c.jpg?v=1635954529", "available": true, "price": "22.99", "grams": 454, "compare_at_price": "27.95", "position": 1}, {"id": 43556329488583, "parent_id": 7830523740359, "handle": "f-8500", "vendor": "Rabbi Boruch Cohen", "tags": ["Author_Rabbi Boruch Cohen", "Categories_Jewish Thought", "Jewish Thought"], "options": [{"name": "Title", "position": 1, "values": ["Default Title"]}], "title": "Think Outside The Lox", "body_html": "\nA Fresh Perspective On JewishTeachings And Traditions\nThey Say That YouCan't Judge A BookBy Its CoverBut this book is different.\nThink Outside the Lox is a new collection of transformative essaysrevealing fresh perspectives on Jewish teachings and traditions,based on age-old Chassidic texts and the insights of the BaalShem Tov.

And he's here with you, in Twerski on Machzor, to help you discover the depth and meaning of the Rosh Hashanah Machzor.\nThrough stories and explanations, we begin to learn so many things about Rosh Hashanah and its prayers:\n\nHow can we relate to Hashem as our King? As our Father? As both at the same time?\nWhy does the word tefillah mean so much than merely a prayer?\nWhy do we eat symbolic foods on Rosh Hashanah; aren't our prayers enough?\nWhat is the highest honor a person can attain? And why do we try to attain it on Rosh Hashanah?World - renowned psychiatrist, bestselling author, and beloved rav, Rabbi Dr. Twerski has been guiding us for decades. And now, with Twerski on Machzor, we can take him to synagogue with us on Rosh Hashanah, to ensure a meaningful prayer experience - and a very happy new year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSku:\nTWOMP\n\n\nAuthor:\nRabbi Dr. Abraham J.

The Gemara emphasizes that he needed atonement whether he walked into the Mikdash and didn't realize that he was impure, or whether he knew he was impure but didn't realize that he had walked into the Mikdash. \n\n\nRav Yaakov Galinsky, zt\"l, asked a question about this: The Gemara is talking about the Beis HaMikdash in all its glory-the kohanim serving, the Levites singing. Could it possibly be that a person entered the Mikdash and didn't realize it? \n\nIt's hard to believe, but yes. Think about it: How many times does a person forget whether he said Birkas HaMazon after he ate, or whether or not he recited Ya'aleh V'Yavo in Shemoneh Esrei? When a person lacks awareness, he makes mistakes and loses his focus. He could even forget that he's standing in the very Courtyard of the Beis HaMikdash! \n\nIn delivering his derashos, Rav Galinsky's aim was to inspire, to awaken, to make people aware. To give meaning and focus to the tefillos we pray, the Torah we learn, the mitzvos we do. And he did it with a smile and a well-placed joke, a captivating story, and a riveting devar Torah. \n\nRav Galinsky delivered thousands of derashos in the halls of yeshivos and batei midrash, and before huge audiences, both religious and nonreligious. He is responsible for bringing so many people closer to Hashem. \n\nNow his derashos are finally accessible in print to the English-speaking audience. \n\nIn his unique, penetrating style-with stories and parables, lessons and maxims, pesukim and ma'amarei Chazal-he brings the weekly parashah alive.
